üîç Running test: Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct | Task: assert_generation | Best: exemplar_selection_knn vs Other: sg_in_context_learning

1. **Contextual Relevance**: Exemplar selection KNN provides more contextually relevant examples by selecting the most similar code snippets from a large dataset. This ensures that the assertions generated are closely aligned with the specific patterns and structures present in the provided code, leading to higher quality and more accurate assertions.

2. **Focused Prompting**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique focuses on enriching the prompt with the most relevant examples, which helps the model to understand the specific requirements and expected outcomes of the code. This focused approach minimizes the chances of generating irrelevant or incorrect assertions.

3. **Consistent Quality**: By using a k-nearest neighbor approach, exemplar_selection_knn ensures a consistent quality of responses across different prompts. The model benefits from a diverse yet highly relevant set of examples, which helps in maintaining a high standard of assertion generation without the variability seen in the sg_in_context_learning technique.üîç Running test: deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3 | Task: assert_generation | Best: exemplar_selection_knn vs Other: sg_in_context_learning

1. **Contextual Relevance**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique selects the most similar code examples using a k-nearest neighbor approach, ensuring that the provided examples are highly relevant to the task at hand. This relevance helps the model generate more accurate assertions by leveraging patterns and structures from closely related code snippets. In contrast, sg_in_context_learning may generate less relevant examples, leading to assertions that don't fully align with the code's requirements.

2. **Consistency in Patterns**: By using exemplar_selection_knn, the model is exposed to consistent patterns and assertion types from similar code examples, which reinforces the correct way to formulate assertions. This consistency reduces variability in the model's responses. On the other hand, sg_in_context_learning might introduce variability by auto-generating examples that don't consistently follow the same patterns, resulting in less reliable assertions.

3. **Precision in Assertion Generation**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique's focus on similar examples allows the model to generate precise assertions that match the specific context of the code, such as checking method return values or exception handling. This precision is often lost in sg_in_context_learning, where the generated examples might not capture the exact nuances of the code, leading to generic or incorrect assertions.üîç Running test: meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo | Task: assert_generation | Best: exemplar_selection_knn vs Other: universal_self_consistency

1. **Contextual Relevance**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique performs better because it selects the most similar code examples to enrich the prompt context, making the generated assertions more relevant to the specific code snippet. This relevance is crucial for assert generation, as it ensures that the assertions are tailored to the particular code's functionality and requirements. By leveraging similar code examples, the technique can better understand the code's intent and generate more accurate assertions.
2. **Focused Knowledge Retrieval**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique outperforms universal_self_consistency because it focuses on retrieving knowledge from the most relevant code examples, rather than aggregating multiple reasoning outputs. This focused approach allows the technique to tap into the specific knowledge and patterns embedded in the similar code examples, resulting in more precise and effective assertions. In contrast, universal_self_consistency may introduce noise or irrelevant information, leading to less accurate assertions.
3. **Reduced Ambiguity**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique reduces ambiguity in assert generation by relying on concrete, similar code examples, rather than relying on abstract reasoning outputs. This reduction in ambiguity enables the technique to generate assertions that are more concise, clear, and directly related to the code's functionality, making them more effective in validating the code's behavior. In contrast, universal_self_consistency may introduce ambiguity by considering multiple, potentially conflicting reasoning outputs, leading to less effective assertions.üîç Running test: o3-mini-2025-01-31 | Task: assert_generation | Best: exemplar_selection_knn vs Other: sg_in_context_learning

1. Relevant Context Retrieval: Exemplar_selection_knn retrieves examples that are closely matched to the specific code snippet, ensuring that the provided assertions are directly applicable. This relevance helps the model align its output better with the task requirements, reducing ambiguity and increasing accuracy.

2. Domain-Specific Guidance: By selecting similar, high-quality code examples from a large corpus, the technique ensures that the assertions follow the conventions and patterns prevalent in the domain. This targeted guidance enables the model to produce more idiomatic and correct assertions compared to auto-generated in-context examples.

3. Noise Reduction and Consistency: Exemplar_selection_knn minimizes the inclusion of irrelevant or misleading context by focusing solely on the most similar examples. This results in a cleaner prompt with less noise, leading to more consistent and precise assertion generation as opposed to the scattered and potentially off-target examples from sg_in_context_learning.
