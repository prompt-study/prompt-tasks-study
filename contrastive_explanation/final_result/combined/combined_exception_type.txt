üîç Running test: Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct | Task: exception_type | Best: exemplar_selection_knn vs Other: thread_of_thought

1. **Contextual Relevance**: Exemplar selection KNN leverages similar code examples to provide contextually relevant responses. This technique ensures that the response is grounded in actual code patterns and exceptions, leading to more accurate and reliable exception type predictions.

2. **Efficiency**: KNN-based exemplar selection is computationally efficient for this task as it quickly retrieves and uses the most relevant examples without the need for detailed step-by-step reasoning. This efficiency allows the model to focus on the specific context of the code snippet rather than engaging in extensive, potentially redundant, thought processes.

3. **Consistency**: By using a set of pre-existing, well-structured examples, KNN ensures consistency in the responses. This consistency is crucial for tasks like exception type prediction, where the model needs to provide uniform and predictable outputs across different code snippets.üîç Running test: deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3 | Task: exception_type | Best: exemplar_selection_knn vs Other: rephrase_and_respond

1. **Contextual Similarity**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique leverages similar code examples to provide context, which helps the model identify patterns and common exception types more accurately. This is particularly effective for exception prediction because the model can draw parallels between the given code and the examples, leading to more precise responses.

2. **Task-Specific Guidance**: By providing specific examples of code and their corresponding exception types, the exemplar_selection_knn technique directly guides the model toward the correct answer. This reduces ambiguity and ensures the model focuses on the relevant aspects of the task, unlike the rephrase_and_respond technique, which may introduce unnecessary elaboration.

3. **Consistency in Formatting**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique enforces a consistent response format (e.g., ###ExceptionType###), which simplifies the task for the model and reduces variability in responses. The rephrase_and_respond technique, while useful for broader tasks, may lead to less structured or verbose answers, which can be less efficient for this specific task.üîç Running test: meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo | Task: exception_type | Best: exemplar_selection_knn vs Other: thread_of_thought

1. **Contextual Relevance**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique performs better because it selects the most similar code examples to enrich the prompt context, making the model more likely to generate accurate responses. This technique ensures that the model is trained on relevant and related code examples, which improves its ability to identify the correct exception type. By leveraging similar code examples, the model can better understand the context and behavior of the code.
2. **Focused Learning**: Exemplar_selection_knn allows the model to focus on the specific task of exception type identification by providing it with a curated set of relevant code examples. This focused learning approach enables the model to develop a deeper understanding of the relationships between code structures and exception types, leading to more accurate predictions. By concentrating on the most relevant examples, the model can learn to recognize patterns and relationships that are critical to exception type identification.
3. **Reduced Ambiguity**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique reduces ambiguity in the model's responses by providing a clear and concise set of examples that illustrate the correct exception type. This clarity helps the model to avoid confusion and misinterpretation, which can occur when using more open-ended techniques like thread_of_thought. By minimizing ambiguity, the exemplar_selection_knn technique enables the model to generate more confident and accurate responses, which is critical for exception type identification tasks.üîç Running test: o3-mini-2025-01-31 | Task: exception_type | Best: rephrase_and_respond vs Other: self_ask

1. Focused Restatement: By rephrasing and expanding on the prompt, the model reinforces its understanding of the code and task requirements. This focused restatement minimizes misinterpretation and keeps the answer directly aligned with the specific exception type needed.

2. Streamlined Response: Rephrase_and_respond encourages the model to internalize and consolidate the main points of the inquiry before responding. This leads to a more concise and direct final answer, avoiding unnecessary digressions that might occur when generating and resolving additional sub-questions.

3. Enhanced Clarity and Format Adherence: The technique explicitly directs the model to restate the query and then supply an answer in a specified format. This dual-step process reduces ambiguity and ensures that the response is formatted correctly and clearly communicates the reasoning behind the selected exception type.
