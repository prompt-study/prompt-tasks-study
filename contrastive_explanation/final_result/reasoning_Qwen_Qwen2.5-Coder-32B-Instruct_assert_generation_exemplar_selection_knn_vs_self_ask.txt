üîç Running test: Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct | Task: assert_generation | Best: exemplar_selection_knn vs Other: self_ask

1. **Contextual Clarity**: Exemplar selection knn provides the model with relevant code examples that serve as context, helping it understand the expected structure and logic of assertions. This contextual clarity allows the model to generate more accurate and meaningful assertions without needing additional clarifications.

2. **Reduced Ambiguity**: By using similar code examples, the exemplar_selection_knn technique reduces ambiguity about the purpose and expected behavior of the code. This approach ensures that the model can infer the correct assertion based on patterns and outcomes seen in the examples, leading to higher quality responses.

3. **Focused Output**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique focuses the model's output directly on generating the assertion statement by leveraging relevant examples, which aligns with the task requirements. In contrast, the self_ask technique often introduces unnecessary clarifying questions, diverting the model from producing the desired assertion statement.
