1. **Contextual Relevance**: Exemplar selection using k-nearest neighbors (knn) provides contextually relevant examples that closely match the given code snippet. This helps the model generate assertions that are more aligned with the specific logic and structure of the provided code, leading to higher quality and more accurate assertions.

2. **Directness**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique focuses on directly providing relevant examples without the need for iterative refinement. This direct approach avoids the potential pitfalls of iterative feedback loops, where the model might introduce errors or misinterpretations during the refinement process.

3. **Consistency**: By using a set of pre-selected, high-quality examples, the exemplar_selection_knn technique ensures consistency in the style and format of the generated assertions. This consistency is crucial for maintaining the reliability and readability of the assertions across different code snippets.
