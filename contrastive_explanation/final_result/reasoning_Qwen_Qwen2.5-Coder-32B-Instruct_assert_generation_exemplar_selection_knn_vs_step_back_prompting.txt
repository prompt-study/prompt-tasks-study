üîç Running test: Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct | Task: assert_generation | Best: exemplar_selection_knn vs Other: step_back_prompting

1. **Contextual Relevance**: Exemplar selection KNN provides contextually relevant examples by selecting the most similar code snippets, which helps the model understand the specific patterns and structures of the code it is working with. This leads to more accurate and meaningful assertions that align with the code's intended functionality.

2. **Focused Guidance**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique focuses the model's attention on specific, relevant examples, reducing the likelihood of generating generic or incorrect assertions. This focused guidance ensures that the model's response is tailored to the nuances of the provided code snippet.

3. **Improved Consistency**: By using similar code examples, the exemplar_selection_knn technique promotes consistency in the generated assertions. This consistency is crucial for maintaining high-quality and reliable test cases, as the model learns from well-structured and correct assertions in the examples.
