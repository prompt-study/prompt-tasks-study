üîç Running test: Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct | Task: assert_generation | Best: exemplar_selection_knn vs Other: style_prompting

1. **Contextual Relevance**: Exemplar selection knn provides the model with relevant code examples that are similar to the input code, allowing it to understand the context and structure better. This context helps the model generate more accurate and appropriate assertions that align with the code's logic and expected outcomes.

2. **Consistent Format**: By using exemplar selection knn, the model learns from a variety of correctly formatted assertions, which helps it maintain consistency in its output format. This consistency is crucial for generating assertions that are syntactically correct and follow the expected style of the codebase.

3. **Semantic Understanding**: The technique of selecting similar examples allows the model to grasp the semantic meaning and intent behind the code, leading to more meaningful assertions. This semantic understanding ensures that the generated assertions effectively validate the key properties and outcomes of the code, rather than just matching a specific style or tone.
