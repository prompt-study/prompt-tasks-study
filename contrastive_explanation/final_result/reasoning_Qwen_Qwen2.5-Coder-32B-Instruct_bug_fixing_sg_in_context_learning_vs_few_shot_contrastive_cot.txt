üîç Running test: Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct | Task: bug_fixing | Best: sg_in_context_learning vs Other: few_shot_contrastive_cot

1. **Contextual Examples**: The **sg_in_context_learning** technique provides in-context examples of both buggy and fixed code, which helps the model understand the specific patterns and corrections needed. This context allows the model to generate more accurate and relevant fixes by learning from similar examples directly.

2. **Comprehensive Fixes**: The **sg_in_context_learning** technique encourages the model to deliver a comprehensive explanation of the fixes, including improvements in naming conventions, formatting, and logical structure. This results in higher-quality code that not only resolves the bug but also adheres to best practices, leading to better evaluation scores.

3. **Reduced Redundancy**: The **sg_in_context_learning** technique focuses on providing clear and concise fixes without unnecessary reasoning or steps, which can sometimes clutter the response. This streamlined approach ensures that the model's output is more focused and directly addresses the bug, improving the overall quality and relevance of the fix.
