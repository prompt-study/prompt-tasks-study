üîç Running test: Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct | Task: bug_fixing | Best: sg_in_context_learning vs Other: universal_self_consistency

1. **Simplicity and Focus**: The **sg_in_context_learning** technique provides a straightforward prompt that focuses on delivering a corrected version of the code with minimal additional explanation. This direct approach ensures that the response is concise and directly addresses the bug, making it easier to implement and verify.

2. **Readability and Formatting**: The **sg_in_context_learning** technique emphasizes readability and proper formatting by including comments that highlight specific changes made to the code. This makes the corrected code more understandable and maintainable, which is crucial for bug fixing tasks.

3. **Consistent Naming Conventions**: The **sg_in_context_learning** technique consistently applies Java naming conventions (e.g., camelCase for methods and variables) in the corrected code. This adherence to standard conventions improves code quality and ensures that the code aligns with typical Java coding standards, reducing the likelihood of introducing new bugs through inconsistent naming.
