üîç Running test: Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct | Task: clone_detection | Best: emotional_prompting vs Other: self_refine

1. **Simplicity and Clarity**: The **emotional_prompting** technique provides a straightforward and clear instruction, focusing on the task at hand without the need for iterative refinement. This simplicity helps the model to concentrate on the core requirement of determining whether the code fragments are exact copies, leading to more accurate and concise responses.

2. **Reduced Cognitive Load**: By avoiding the iterative self-evaluation and refinement process, **emotional_prompting** reduces the cognitive load on the model. The model does not need to re-evaluate its initial assessment or incorporate feedback, which can introduce errors or inconsistencies. This streamlined approach ensures that the model's initial analysis is the final answer, maintaining consistency and reliability.

3. **Focused Task Execution**: The **emotional_prompting** prompts are designed to engage the model with a clear, focused task, emphasizing the importance of precision and analytical strength. This focused execution aligns well with the specific requirements of the clone detection task, where the primary goal is to determine exact code duplication without the need for additional context or iterative improvements.
