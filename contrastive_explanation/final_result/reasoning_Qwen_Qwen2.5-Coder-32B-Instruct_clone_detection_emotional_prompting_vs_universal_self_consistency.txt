üîç Running test: Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct | Task: clone_detection | Best: emotional_prompting vs Other: universal_self_consistency

In the context of the provided examples, the **emotional_prompting** technique appears to perform better than the **universal_self_consistency** technique for the task of clone detection. Here are three reasons why:

1. **Simplicity and Clarity**: Emotional prompting uses straightforward and clear instructions, which are easier for the model to interpret and follow. The prompts are direct and to the point, asking for a simple TRUE or FALSE response, which reduces the likelihood of misinterpretation or overthinking.

2. **Reduced Overhead**: Emotional prompting does not introduce additional complexity through meta-prompting or multiple reasoning outputs. This simplicity means the model can focus solely on the task at hand without the overhead of aggregating or choosing between multiple responses, leading to more efficient and accurate evaluations.

3. **Consistent Format**: The emotional_prompting technique consistently asks for a response in a specific format (###TRUE### or ###FALSE###), which the model can reliably adhere to. This consistency ensures that the output is uniform and easily machine-readable, facilitating accurate evaluation and comparison.
