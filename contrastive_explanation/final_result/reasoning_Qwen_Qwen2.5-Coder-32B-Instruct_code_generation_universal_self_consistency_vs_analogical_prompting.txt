üîç Running test: Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct | Task: code_generation | Best: universal_self_consistency vs Other: analogical_prompting

1. **Comprehensive Implementation**: Universal self-consistency generates more comprehensive and detailed code by aggregating multiple reasoning outputs. This ensures that all specified fields, methods, and logic are included, leading to a more complete and functional solution.

2. **Consistent Structure**: The technique maintains a consistent structure across different responses, aligning closely with the majority opinion. This reduces variability and ensures that the final selected response is reliable and well-structured.

3. **Detailed Explanations**: Universal self-consistency provides detailed explanations for each part of the code, which aids in understanding the purpose and functionality of each method and field. This clarity is crucial for maintaining and expanding the code in the future.
