üîç Running test: Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct | Task: code_generation | Best: universal_self_consistency vs Other: few_shot_contrastive_cot

1. **Comprehensive Implementation**: The **universal_self_consistency** technique generates more comprehensive and detailed code implementations. It aggregates multiple reasoning outputs to ensure that all specified fields, methods, and logic are included, resulting in a more complete and functional solution.

2. **Consistent Structure**: This technique maintains a consistent structure across different prompts, ensuring that the generated code aligns closely with the task requirements. It avoids the fragmented or incomplete responses that can occur when relying on a single reasoning path, as seen in the **few_shot_contrastive_cot** technique.

3. **Error Handling and Logic**: The **universal_self_consistency** technique often includes error handling and logical checks, which are crucial for robust code. By aggregating multiple responses, it can identify and incorporate the most appropriate logic, leading to more reliable and error-free code compared to the more simplistic and sometimes incorrect logic provided by the **few_shot_contrastive_cot** technique.
