üîç Running test: Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct | Task: code_generation | Best: universal_self_consistency vs Other: role_prompting

1. **Comprehensive Implementation**: The **universal_self_consistency** technique generates more comprehensive and detailed code implementations. By aggregating multiple reasoning outputs, it ensures that all specified fields, methods, and constants are included, providing a complete and functional solution.

2. **Consistent Error Handling and Logic**: This technique promotes consistency in error handling and logical flow across the generated code. By selecting the most coherent solution based on majority consensus, it avoids inconsistencies and ensures that the code behaves as expected in various scenarios.

3. **Contextual Understanding**: The **universal_self_consistency** approach demonstrates a deeper understanding of the task context. It considers the relationships between different parts of the code and provides explanations for each component, leading to a more robust and contextually appropriate solution.
