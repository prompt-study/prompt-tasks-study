üîç Running test: Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct | Task: code_generation | Best: universal_self_consistency vs Other: sg_in_context_learning

1. **Clarity and Focus**: The **universal_self_consistency** technique provides a more focused and clear prompt by aggregating multiple reasoning outputs and selecting the most coherent solution. This ensures that the generated code aligns closely with the task requirements and avoids unnecessary details or contradictions.

2. **Consistency Across Responses**: By using a meta-prompt to choose the most consistent solution, **universal_self_consistency** ensures that the final code snippet is consistent with the majority view, reducing the likelihood of errors or inconsistencies that might arise from different interpretations of the task.

3. **Detailed and Comprehensive Solutions**: The **universal_self_consistency** technique often generates more detailed and comprehensive solutions by synthesizing information from multiple responses. This results in code that not only fulfills the task but also includes explanations and additional context, making it more robust and easier to understand.
