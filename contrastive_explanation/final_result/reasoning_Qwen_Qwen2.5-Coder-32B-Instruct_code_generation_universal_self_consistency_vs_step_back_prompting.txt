üîç Running test: Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct | Task: code_generation | Best: universal_self_consistency vs Other: step_back_prompting

1. **Comprehensive Implementation**: The **universal_self_consistency** technique generates more comprehensive and detailed code by aggregating multiple reasoning outputs. This ensures that all specified fields, methods, and inner classes are included, providing a complete and functional solution.

2. **Consistent Methodology**: By using a meta-prompt to choose the most coherent solution, **universal_self_consistency** ensures that the final code aligns with the majority opinion, leading to a more consistent and reliable implementation. This reduces the likelihood of missing important details or including contradictory elements.

3. **Detailed Explanations**: The **universal_self_consistency** technique often includes detailed explanations for each part of the code, which aids in understanding the purpose and functionality of the generated code. This additional context helps in maintaining and expanding the codebase effectively.
