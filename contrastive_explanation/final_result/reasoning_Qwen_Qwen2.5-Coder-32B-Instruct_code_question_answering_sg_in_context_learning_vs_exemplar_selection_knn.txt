üîç Running test: Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct | Task: code_question_answering | Best: sg_in_context_learning vs Other: exemplar_selection_knn

1. **Contextual Understanding**: The `sg_in_context_learning` technique generates in-context examples that simulate few-shot learning, allowing the model to better understand the nuances and requirements of the question. This results in more accurate evaluations of whether the provided code fully answers the question, as the model can draw on a broader, more relevant context.

2. **Adaptive Responses**: By auto-generating examples, `sg_in_context_learning` can adapt to the specific nuances of each question and code snippet, providing more tailored and accurate responses. This adaptability is crucial for tasks like code question answering, where the context and details of the question can significantly influence the appropriateness of the code.

3. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: The `sg_in_context_learning` technique encourages a more comprehensive evaluation of the code by providing detailed context and examples. This leads to more thorough assessments, as the model can consider multiple aspects of the question and code, ensuring that the response is both accurate and complete.
