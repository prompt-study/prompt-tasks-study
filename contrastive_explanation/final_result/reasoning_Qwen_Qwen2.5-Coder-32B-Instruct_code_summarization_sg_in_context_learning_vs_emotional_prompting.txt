üîç Running test: Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct | Task: code_summarization | Best: sg_in_context_learning vs Other: emotional_prompting

1. **Conciseness**: The `sg_in_context_learning` technique generates concise summaries that align with the task requirements, providing a brief yet comprehensive description of the code. In contrast, the `emotional_prompting` technique often produces verbose explanations that include unnecessary details and step-by-step breakdowns, which do not meet the criteria for a concise summary.

2. **Relevance**: The summaries generated by `sg_in_context_learning` are directly relevant to the code's functionality, focusing on the key aspects without extraneous emotional or motivational language. The `emotional_prompting` technique, however, includes motivational phrases and considerations that are not pertinent to the task of summarizing code, leading to less focused and less relevant responses.

3. **Accuracy**: The `sg_in_context_learning` technique provides accurate and technically precise summaries that capture the essential logic and purpose of the code. The `emotional_prompting` technique, while well-intentioned, sometimes introduces inaccuracies or overly detailed explanations that can misrepresent the code's functionality, reducing the overall accuracy of the summary.
