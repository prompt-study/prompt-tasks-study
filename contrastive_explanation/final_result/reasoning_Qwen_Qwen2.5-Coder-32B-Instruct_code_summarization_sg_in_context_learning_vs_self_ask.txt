üîç Running test: Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct | Task: code_summarization | Best: sg_in_context_learning vs Other: self_ask

1. **Conciseness**: The `sg_in_context_learning` technique generates more concise summaries. By providing in-context examples, the model learns to distill the essence of the code into a single, clear sentence, which is more aligned with the task requirements of code summarization.

2. **Relevance**: The summaries produced by `sg_in_context_learning` are more directly relevant to the code's functionality. The technique focuses on extracting the core purpose and behavior of the code without getting sidetracked by unnecessary clarifications or assumptions, leading to more accurate and focused summaries.

3. **Efficiency**: The `sg_in_context_learning` technique is more efficient in generating summaries. It avoids the overhead of asking and answering clarifying questions, which can lead to longer and less focused responses. This efficiency allows the model to produce high-quality summaries more quickly and with less computational effort.
