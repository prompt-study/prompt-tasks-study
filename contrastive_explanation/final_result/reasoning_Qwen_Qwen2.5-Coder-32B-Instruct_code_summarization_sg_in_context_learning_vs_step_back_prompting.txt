üîç Running test: Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct | Task: code_summarization | Best: sg_in_context_learning vs Other: step_back_prompting

1. **Conciseness**: The `sg_in_context_learning` technique generates more concise summaries by focusing on the essential functionality of the code without delving into unnecessary details. This aligns with the task requirement of creating a one-sentence summary, making the response more directly relevant and easier to understand.

2. **Relevance**: The summaries produced by `sg_in_context_learning` are more directly relevant to the code's primary function. By providing examples and context, the technique ensures that the summary captures the main purpose and behavior of the code without extraneous information, leading to higher quality and more accurate summaries.

3. **Efficiency**: The `sg_in_context_learning` technique is more efficient in generating summaries because it leverages in-context examples to simulate few-shot learning, which helps the model understand the task requirements more effectively. This results in quicker and more accurate responses, as the model can draw on the provided examples to craft concise and relevant summaries.
