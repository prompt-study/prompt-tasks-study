üîç Running test: Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct | Task: code_summarization | Best: sg_in_context_learning vs Other: style_prompting

1. **Conciseness**: The `sg_in_context_learning` technique generates more concise summaries. By providing in-context examples, the model learns to distill the essence of the code into a single, clear sentence, which aligns with the task's requirement for brevity.

2. **Relevance**: The summaries produced by `sg_in_context_learning` are more directly relevant to the task. The technique focuses on generating summaries that capture the primary functionality of the code without unnecessary details, making the output more focused and task-specific.

3. **Consistency**: The `sg_in_context_learning` technique maintains a consistent format and style across different code snippets. By simulating few-shot learning, the model learns to follow a uniform pattern for summarization, ensuring that all summaries are presented in a similar manner, which enhances readability and coherence.
