üîç Running test: Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct | Task: code_summarization | Best: sg_in_context_learning vs Other: tree_of_thought

1. **Conciseness**: The `sg_in_context_learning` technique generates more concise summaries. It directly provides a one-sentence summary that captures the essence of the code without unnecessary details, which aligns better with the task requirements for code summarization.

2. **Relevance**: The summaries produced by `sg_in_context_learning` are more relevant to the task. They focus on the primary functionality of the code without delving into intermediate steps or detailed breakdowns, making them easier to understand and more aligned with the goal of summarization.

3. **Efficiency**: The `sg_in_context_learning` technique is more efficient in generating summaries. It avoids the iterative reasoning and intermediate outputs required by `tree_of_thought`, leading to faster and more direct responses that are better suited for the task of concise code summarization.
