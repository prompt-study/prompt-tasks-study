üîç Running test: Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct | Task: code_summarization | Best: sg_in_context_learning vs Other: universal_self_consistency

1. **Conciseness**: The `sg_in_context_learning` technique generates more concise summaries. It directly provides a one-sentence summary that captures the essence of the code without unnecessary details, which aligns well with the task requirements for code summarization.

2. **Clarity**: The summaries produced by `sg_in_context_learning` are clearer and easier to understand. They avoid the verbose and step-by-step breakdowns that can sometimes make the summaries from `universal_self_consistency` less straightforward and harder to follow.

3. **Relevance**: The `sg_in_context_learning` technique focuses on the most relevant aspects of the code, omitting extraneous information. This results in summaries that are more directly aligned with the core functionality of the code, whereas `universal_self_consistency` can sometimes include less pertinent details in its comprehensive explanations.
