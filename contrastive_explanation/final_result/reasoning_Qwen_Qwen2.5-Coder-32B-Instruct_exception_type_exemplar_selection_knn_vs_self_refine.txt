üîç Running test: Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct | Task: exception_type | Best: exemplar_selection_knn vs Other: self_refine

1. **Contextual Relevance**: Exemplar selection KNN leverages similar code examples to enrich the prompt context, providing the model with relevant examples that guide it towards accurate exception type predictions. This contextual support helps the model understand the specific scenarios and exceptions that are likely to occur in similar code structures.

2. **Directness of Response**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique prompts the model to provide a direct and concise answer in the specified format (###ExceptionType###), reducing the likelihood of the model generating extraneous or incorrect information. This directness ensures that the response is focused and relevant to the task at hand.

3. **Reduced Iterative Overhead**: Unlike self_refine, which involves iterative self-evaluation and updating of responses, exemplar_selection_knn provides a single, informed response based on the nearest neighbors. This reduces the computational overhead and time required to generate a response, making the process more efficient and less prone to errors introduced through multiple iterations.
