üîç Running test: Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct | Task: exception_type | Best: exemplar_selection_knn vs Other: style_prompting

1. **Contextual Relevance**: Exemplar selection KNN provides contextually relevant examples by selecting the most similar code snippets, which helps the model understand the specific scenario and the type of exception that is most likely to occur in that context. This leads to more accurate predictions compared to style prompting, which focuses on tone and format rather than content.

2. **Specificity in Exception Handling**: KNN-based techniques enrich the prompt with specific examples of exception handling, allowing the model to learn the nuances of different exception types in various code situations. This specificity is crucial for tasks like exception type prediction, where the exact type of exception can vary based on the operation being performed. Style prompting, on the other hand, does not provide this level of specific context.

3. **Improved Generalization**: By using similar code examples, the model can generalize better to new, unseen code snippets. This is because the model learns from a variety of real-world examples, which helps it make informed decisions about the appropriate exception type. Style prompting, while ensuring consistency in tone and format, does not necessarily improve the model's ability to generalize to different coding scenarios.
