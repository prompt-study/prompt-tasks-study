üîç Running test: Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct | Task: exception_type | Best: exemplar_selection_knn vs Other: thread_of_thought

1. **Contextual Relevance**: Exemplar selection KNN leverages similar code examples to provide contextually relevant responses. This technique ensures that the response is grounded in actual code patterns and exceptions, leading to more accurate and reliable exception type predictions.

2. **Efficiency**: KNN-based exemplar selection is computationally efficient for this task as it quickly retrieves and uses the most relevant examples without the need for detailed step-by-step reasoning. This efficiency allows the model to focus on the specific context of the code snippet rather than engaging in extensive, potentially redundant, thought processes.

3. **Consistency**: By using a set of pre-existing, well-structured examples, KNN ensures consistency in the responses. This consistency is crucial for tasks like exception type prediction, where the model needs to provide uniform and predictable outputs across different code snippets.
