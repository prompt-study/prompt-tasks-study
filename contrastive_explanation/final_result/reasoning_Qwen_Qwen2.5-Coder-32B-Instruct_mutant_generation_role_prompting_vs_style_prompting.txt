üîç Running test: Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct | Task: mutant_generation | Best: role_prompting vs Other: style_prompting

1. **Clear Intent Focus**: Role prompting assigns a specific persona (e.g., Software Architect, Code Reviewer) to the task, which helps the model understand the intent behind generating mutants. This focus ensures that the model makes small, semantically meaningful changes rather than altering the code's structure or logic significantly, leading to higher quality mutants.

2. **Contextual Understanding**: By adopting a role, the model gains a deeper understanding of the context in which the code operates. This context-awareness allows the model to make more informed decisions about which parts of the code to mutate, ensuring that the mutants remain syntactically correct and semantically altered, as required for assessing test suite robustness.

3. **Consistent Output Format**: Role prompting naturally leads to a consistent output format because the model is guided by the expectations of the assigned role. For instance, a Code Reviewer would be expected to provide a mutated version of the code without additional commentary or restructuring, which aligns with the task requirements and results in higher evaluation scores.
