üîç Running test: deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3 | Task: assert_generation | Best: exemplar_selection_knn vs Other: analogical_prompting

1. **Contextual Relevance**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique selects the most similar code examples using a k-nearest neighbor approach, ensuring that the provided context is highly relevant to the task at hand. This relevance helps the model generate assertions that are directly applicable to the given code snippet, unlike analogical_prompting, which may rely on abstract or less directly applicable analogies.

2. **Precision in Assertion Generation**: By leveraging concrete examples that closely match the input code, exemplar_selection_knn allows the model to produce precise and accurate assertions. Analogical_prompting, on the other hand, might introduce ambiguity or generalization, leading to less precise assertions that don't fully capture the intended validation logic.

3. **Consistency with Testing Frameworks**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique often results in assertions that align with standard testing frameworks (e.g., JUnit), as seen in the examples. Analogical_prompting may generate assertions that are syntactically or semantically incorrect for the target framework, reducing their practical utility in real-world testing scenarios.
