üîç Running test: deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3 | Task: bug_fixing | Best: sg_in_context_learning vs Other: emotional_prompting

1. **Structured Demonstration**: The sg_in_context_learning technique provides clear examples of buggy and fixed code, which helps the model understand the task better. By showing both the problem and solution, the model can more accurately identify and replicate the fixes in the provided code. Emotional prompting lacks this structured guidance, leading to less precise responses.

2. **Technical Focus**: sg_in_context_learning emphasizes technical correctness and logical improvements, such as null checks or variable initialization, which are critical for bug fixing. Emotional prompting, while engaging, often prioritizes affective language over technical rigor, resulting in responses that may miss key technical details or oversimplify the fix.

3. **Consistency in Examples**: The in-context examples generated by sg_in_context_learning ensure the model follows a consistent pattern for identifying and resolving bugs. Emotional prompting, on the other hand, varies widely in tone and focus, which can lead to inconsistent or less reliable fixes, as seen in the comparison responses where technical issues were sometimes overlooked.
