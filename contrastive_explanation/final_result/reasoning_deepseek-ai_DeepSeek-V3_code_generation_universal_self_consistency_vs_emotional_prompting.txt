üîç Running test: deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3 | Task: code_generation | Best: universal_self_consistency vs Other: emotional_prompting

1. **Consistency in Logic Implementation**: The universal_self_consistency technique aggregates multiple reasoning outputs to select the most coherent solution, ensuring that the code logic is robust and well-structured. In contrast, emotional_prompting focuses on affective language, which may not prioritize logical correctness or completeness in code generation.

2. **Comprehensive Method Coverage**: Universal_self_consistency tends to produce responses that include all specified methods and fields, as seen in the examples where it provided full class implementations. Emotional_prompting, however, often generates partial or repetitive code snippets, missing key components or duplicating methods without adding value.

3. **Clarity and Readability**: The responses from universal_self_consistency are clearer and more readable, often including explanations and usage examples. Emotional_prompting responses, while engaging, can be cluttered with unnecessary emotional language or redundant code, reducing their practical utility for developers.
