üîç Running test: deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3 | Task: code_generation | Best: universal_self_consistency vs Other: few_shot_contrastive_cot

1. **Consistency in Output Quality**: The universal_self_consistency technique aggregates multiple reasoning outputs and selects the most coherent solution, ensuring a higher quality and more reliable response. In contrast, few_shot_contrastive_cot relies on contrasting correct and incorrect examples, which can sometimes lead to inconsistent or less optimal solutions if the examples are not perfectly aligned with the task.

2. **Robustness to Ambiguity**: Universal_self_consistency is better at handling ambiguous or complex task descriptions by leveraging multiple perspectives to arrive at a consensus. Few_shot_contrastive_cot, while useful for debugging, may struggle with ambiguity if the provided examples do not cover all edge cases or nuances of the task.

3. **Comprehensive Solution Generation**: The universal_self_consistency technique tends to produce more comprehensive and detailed solutions, as it synthesizes the best aspects of multiple responses. Few_shot_contrastive_cot, focused on contrasting examples, might miss broader context or produce more minimalistic solutions that lack depth or completeness.
