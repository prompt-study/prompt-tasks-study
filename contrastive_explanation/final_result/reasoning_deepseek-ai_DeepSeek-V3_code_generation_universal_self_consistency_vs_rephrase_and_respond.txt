üîç Running test: deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3 | Task: code_generation | Best: universal_self_consistency vs Other: rephrase_and_respond

1. **Majority Consensus for Robustness**: The universal_self_consistency technique aggregates multiple reasoning outputs and selects the most coherent solution, which reduces the likelihood of errors or inconsistencies. This ensures the final response is more reliable and aligns with the majority of valid interpretations, whereas rephrase_and_respond relies on a single, potentially less refined output.

2. **Contextual Depth and Clarity**: Universal_self_consistency leverages multiple prompts to explore the task from different angles, leading to a more comprehensive and contextually rich response. In contrast, rephrase_and_respond may oversimplify or miss nuances by focusing on restating the prompt without deeper exploration.

3. **Structured and Detailed Outputs**: The self-consistency method often produces more structured and detailed code snippets, as it synthesizes the best parts of multiple responses. Rephrase_and_respond, while useful for clarity, may generate less optimized or incomplete code due to its focus on rephrasing rather than synthesis.
