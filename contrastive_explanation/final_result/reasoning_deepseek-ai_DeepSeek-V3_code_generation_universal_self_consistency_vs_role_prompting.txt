üîç Running test: deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3 | Task: code_generation | Best: universal_self_consistency vs Other: role_prompting

1. **Consensus-Based Quality Control**: The universal_self_consistency technique aggregates multiple reasoning outputs and selects the most coherent solution, ensuring higher quality and robustness. This reduces the risk of errors or inconsistencies that might arise from a single, potentially biased response in role_prompting.

2. **Comprehensive Implementation**: By leveraging multiple perspectives, universal_self_consistency often produces more complete and detailed implementations, as seen in the examples where it includes additional methods, explanations, and usage examples. Role_prompting, while concise, may omit critical details or context.

3. **Adaptability to Complexity**: Universal_self_consistency handles complex tasks better by synthesizing diverse solutions, making it suitable for tasks requiring nuanced or multi-faceted approaches. Role_prompting, constrained by its persona-based focus, may oversimplify or miss subtleties in the task requirements.
