üîç Running test: deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3 | Task: code_generation | Best: universal_self_consistency vs Other: self_ask

1. **Consensus-Based Robustness**: The universal_self_consistency technique aggregates multiple reasoning outputs and selects the most coherent solution, ensuring a higher-quality response. This reduces the risk of errors or inconsistencies that might arise from a single, potentially flawed reasoning path, which is more likely with the self_ask technique.

2. **Comprehensive Implementation**: By leveraging multiple responses, universal_self_consistency often produces more complete and detailed implementations, including additional methods, explanations, and usage examples. In contrast, self_ask tends to generate minimalistic code snippets, missing context or edge cases.

3. **Contextual Clarity**: The universal_self_consistency technique provides explanatory notes and usage examples, making the response more understandable and practical for real-world use. Self_ask, while efficient, often lacks these contextual details, leaving the user to infer the broader application of the code.
