üîç Running test: deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3 | Task: code_generation | Best: universal_self_consistency vs Other: self_refine

1. **Majority Consensus Validation**: The universal_self_consistency technique aggregates multiple reasoning outputs and selects the most coherent solution based on majority consensus. This ensures that the final response is more reliable and aligned with common best practices, reducing the likelihood of errors or inconsistencies. In contrast, self_refine relies on iterative self-evaluation, which may not always converge to the most optimal solution if the initial response is flawed.

2. **Comprehensive Solution Coverage**: Universal_self_consistency generates multiple responses and combines their strengths, often resulting in a more comprehensive and well-rounded solution. For example, in the code generation tasks, it provided detailed explanations and usage examples, which are missing in the self_refine responses. Self_refine, while iterative, may miss broader context or edge cases if the initial feedback loop is narrow.

3. **Error Reduction Through Aggregation**: By leveraging multiple responses, universal_self_consistency inherently reduces the risk of errors by filtering out outliers or incorrect solutions. This is particularly useful in complex tasks where a single iteration (as in self_refine) might overlook subtle bugs or logical flaws. The aggregated response tends to be more robust and validated by multiple perspectives.
