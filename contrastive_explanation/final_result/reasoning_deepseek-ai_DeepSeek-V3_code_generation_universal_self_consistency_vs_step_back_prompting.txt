üîç Running test: deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3 | Task: code_generation | Best: universal_self_consistency vs Other: step_back_prompting

1. **Majority Consensus for Robustness**: The universal_self_consistency technique aggregates multiple reasoning outputs and selects the most coherent solution based on majority consensus. This ensures the final response is more reliable and less prone to errors, as it leverages the collective intelligence of multiple generated solutions. In contrast, step_back_prompting relies on a single reasoning path, which may not always capture the best approach.

2. **Detailed Implementation Guidance**: Universal_self_consistency provides comprehensive and detailed code implementations, including explanations and usage examples. This makes the response more actionable and informative for the user. Step_back_prompting, while structured, often produces more generic or incomplete code snippets without additional context or rationale.

3. **Error Reduction through Validation**: By comparing and validating multiple responses, universal_self_consistency minimizes the risk of logical or syntactical errors in the final output. This validation step ensures higher-quality code. Step_back_prompting lacks this validation mechanism, making it more susceptible to oversights or inaccuracies in the generated code.
