üîç Running test: deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3 | Task: code_generation | Best: universal_self_consistency vs Other: style_prompting

1. **Consistency in Logic Implementation**: The universal_self_consistency technique aggregates multiple reasoning outputs to choose the most coherent solution, ensuring that the generated code adheres to logical correctness and completeness. In contrast, style_prompting focuses on tone or format, which may overlook critical logical or structural aspects of the code.

2. **Comprehensive Coverage of Requirements**: By leveraging majority consensus, universal_self_consistency ensures that all specified methods and fields are included, addressing the full scope of the task. Style_prompting, however, may prioritize stylistic elements over functional completeness, leading to partial or incomplete implementations.

3. **Error Reduction through Aggregation**: Universal_self_consistency reduces the likelihood of errors by cross-validating multiple responses and selecting the most accurate one. Style_prompting, being more focused on presentation, lacks this validation mechanism, making it more prone to oversights or inaccuracies in the generated code.
