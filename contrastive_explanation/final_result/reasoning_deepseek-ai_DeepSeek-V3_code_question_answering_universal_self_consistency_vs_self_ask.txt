üîç Running test: deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3 | Task: code_question_answering | Best: universal_self_consistency vs Other: self_ask

1. **Robust Consensus Evaluation**: The universal_self_consistency technique aggregates multiple reasoning outputs and selects the most coherent solution, which reduces the likelihood of errors or biases in the final response. By leveraging a meta-prompt to choose the majority consensus, it ensures a more reliable and accurate evaluation of the code snippet's adequacy, whereas self_ask relies on a single pass of reasoning, which may miss nuances.

2. **Contextual Depth in Analysis**: Universal_self_consistency provides a more thorough analysis by considering multiple perspectives or interpretations of the code snippet. This depth allows it to identify edge cases or contextual mismatches (e.g., class-specific logic vs. general requirements) more effectively than self_ask, which may focus narrowly on clarifying sub-questions without broader context.

3. **Error Mitigation Through Redundancy**: By generating and comparing multiple responses, universal_self_consistency inherently mitigates errors or oversights that might occur in a single reasoning pass. This redundancy ensures that the final response is more robust and aligned with the task's requirements, whereas self_ask's linear approach may overlook inconsistencies or incomplete evaluations.
