üîç Running test: deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3 | Task: code_question_answering | Best: universal_self_consistency vs Other: self_refine

1. **Consensus-Based Accuracy**: The universal_self_consistency technique aggregates multiple reasoning outputs and selects the most coherent solution, which reduces the likelihood of errors or biases present in a single response. This ensures a more accurate and reliable answer, as seen in the examples where it correctly identified missing functionality or context in the code snippets.

2. **Focus on Core Requirements**: Unlike self_refine, which iteratively improves responses but may stray from the original question, universal_self_consistency directly addresses whether the code meets the question's requirements. This focus prevents tangential improvements and keeps the evaluation tightly aligned with the task, as demonstrated by its clear "###FALSE###" responses when the code didn't fulfill the question.

3. **Efficiency in Evaluation**: Universal_self_consistency avoids the iterative refinement process of self_refine, which can be time-consuming and may not always lead to better answers. By leveraging majority consensus, it quickly identifies the most accurate response without unnecessary iterations, as shown in the examples where it provided concise and correct assessments.
