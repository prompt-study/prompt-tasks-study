üîç Running test: deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3 | Task: code_question_answering | Best: universal_self_consistency vs Other: style_prompting

1. **Robust Consensus Building**: The universal_self_consistency technique aggregates multiple reasoning outputs and selects the most coherent solution, which reduces the likelihood of errors or biases in the response. This ensures a more reliable and accurate answer compared to style_prompting, which focuses on stylistic alignment rather than correctness.

2. **Comprehensive Analysis**: By evaluating multiple responses and choosing the one that aligns with the majority consensus, universal_self_consistency provides a more thorough and nuanced understanding of the problem. Style_prompting, on the other hand, may prioritize stylistic preferences over technical accuracy, leading to incomplete or misleading answers.

3. **Error Handling and Clarity**: Universal_self_consistency often includes detailed explanations for why a response is incorrect, offering actionable feedback. Style_prompting may produce responses that are stylistically correct but technically flawed, lacking the depth needed to address complex code-related questions effectively.
