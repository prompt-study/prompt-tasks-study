üîç Running test: deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3 | Task: code_summarization | Best: sg_in_context_learning vs Other: exemplar_selection_knn

1. **Contextual Relevance**: The **sg_in_context_learning** technique generates in-context examples that are specifically tailored to the task of code summarization, ensuring the examples are directly relevant to the code being summarized. In contrast, **exemplar_selection_knn** relies on similarity-based selection, which may include less relevant or overly verbose examples, diluting the focus of the summary. This leads to more precise and concise summaries with **sg_in_context_learning**.

2. **Structured Guidance**: **sg_in_context_learning** provides clear, structured examples marked with labels like `###summary###`, which guide the model to produce outputs in a consistent and desired format. The **exemplar_selection_knn** technique, while providing examples, lacks this explicit formatting, resulting in summaries that may be less aligned with the task requirements or more verbose. The structured approach of **sg_in_context_learning** ensures higher-quality, task-aligned responses.

3. **Task-Specific Optimization**: **sg_in_context_learning** is designed to simulate few-shot learning for software tasks, meaning it optimizes the examples for the specific task of code summarization. **exemplar_selection_knn**, on the other hand, selects examples based on general code similarity, which may not always prioritize summarization quality. This task-specific optimization in **sg_in_context_learning** leads to summaries that are more accurate and succinct.
