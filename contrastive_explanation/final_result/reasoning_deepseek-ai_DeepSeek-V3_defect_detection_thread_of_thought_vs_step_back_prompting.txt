üîç Running test: deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3 | Task: defect_detection | Best: thread_of_thought vs Other: step_back_prompting

1. **Structured Code Analysis**: The thread_of_thought technique breaks down the code into smaller, sequential segments, allowing for a more detailed and systematic examination of each part. This granular approach helps in identifying subtle defects that might be overlooked in a high-level overview provided by step_back_prompting.

2. **Contextual Understanding**: By summarizing and analyzing each code segment as it progresses, thread_of_thought maintains a strong contextual understanding of the code's logic and flow. This continuous reasoning process is more effective for defect detection than the abstract guidelines used in step_back_prompting, which may miss specific implementation details.

3. **Defect Localization**: Thread_of_thought explicitly ties analysis to specific lines or blocks of code, making it easier to pinpoint the exact location and nature of defects. In contrast, step_back_prompting's broader focus on general principles can lead to vague or less actionable insights about where and why a defect exists.
