üîç Running test: deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3 | Task: exception_type | Best: exemplar_selection_knn vs Other: few_shot_contrastive_cot

1. **Code-Specific Context Matching**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique selects the most similar code examples using a k-nearest neighbor approach, which ensures that the context of the exception handling is closely matched to the given task. This leads to more accurate predictions because the model can directly reference relevant code patterns and their associated exceptions. In contrast, few_shot_contrastive_cot relies on broader reasoning chains, which may not always align precisely with the specific code context.

2. **Precision in Exception Selection**: By leveraging similar code snippets, exemplar_selection_knn can pinpoint the exact exception type that fits the scenario, such as `ValueError` for invalid arguments or `IndexError` for out-of-bounds access. Few_shot_contrastive_cot, while useful for reasoning, may introduce ambiguity or overgeneralization, leading to less precise exception type predictions.

3. **Efficiency in Handling Edge Cases**: The k-nearest neighbor approach excels at identifying edge cases in code, such as rare or specific exceptions like `OSError` or `NotImplementedError`, by drawing from a curated set of similar examples. Few_shot_contrastive_cot, which contrasts correct and incorrect reasoning paths, might struggle with these edge cases if the contrastive examples are not sufficiently representative of the specific code context.
