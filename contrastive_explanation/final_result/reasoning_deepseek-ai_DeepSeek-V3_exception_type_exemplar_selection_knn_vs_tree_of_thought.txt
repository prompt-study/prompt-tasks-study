üîç Running test: deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3 | Task: exception_type | Best: exemplar_selection_knn vs Other: tree_of_thought

1. **Contextual Similarity**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique selects the most similar code examples using a k-nearest neighbor approach, which ensures that the provided context is highly relevant to the task. This relevance helps the model generate more accurate exception predictions by leveraging patterns from closely related code snippets.

2. **Direct Pattern Matching**: By focusing on similar examples, exemplar_selection_knn allows the model to directly match the current code context with previously seen patterns. This reduces the need for complex reasoning and increases the likelihood of correctly identifying the exception type based on established precedents.

3. **Efficiency in Learning**: The technique simplifies the learning process by narrowing down the problem space to a set of closely related examples. This efficiency avoids the overhead of exploring multiple reasoning paths (as in tree_of_thought), leading to faster and more precise responses.
