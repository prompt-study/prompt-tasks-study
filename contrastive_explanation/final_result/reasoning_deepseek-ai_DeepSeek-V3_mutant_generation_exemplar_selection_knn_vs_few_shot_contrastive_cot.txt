üîç Running test: deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3 | Task: mutant_generation | Best: exemplar_selection_knn vs Other: few_shot_contrastive_cot

1. **Contextual Similarity**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique selects the most similar code examples using a k-nearest neighbor approach, which ensures that the provided context is highly relevant to the task. This allows the model to generate mutants that are syntactically correct and semantically meaningful, as it can directly mimic the patterns from similar examples. In contrast, few_shot_contrastive_cot may introduce irrelevant or overly complex reasoning paths, leading to less accurate mutants.

2. **Minimal and Focused Changes**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique emphasizes delivering only the updated code with minimal tweaks, which aligns perfectly with the task of mutant generation. This focus ensures that the mutations are subtle and adhere to the original code's structure. On the other hand, few_shot_contrastive_cot's emphasis on reasoning and contrastive examples can lead to more drastic or less coherent changes, as seen in the comparison examples.

3. **Task-Specific Guidance**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique provides clear, task-specific examples that demonstrate how to mutate code in a controlled manner. This direct guidance helps the model understand the exact expectations for mutant generation. In contrast, few_shot_contrastive_cot's broader focus on reasoning and debugging may distract the model from the precise goal of generating minimal, syntactically correct mutants, resulting in lower-quality outputs.
