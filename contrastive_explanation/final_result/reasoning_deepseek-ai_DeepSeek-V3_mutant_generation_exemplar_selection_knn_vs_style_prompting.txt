üîç Running test: deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3 | Task: mutant_generation | Best: exemplar_selection_knn vs Other: style_prompting

1. **Contextual Relevance**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique provides concrete examples of similar code mutations, which helps the model understand the specific patterns and types of modifications expected. In contrast, style_prompting focuses on tone and format, which is less relevant for a task requiring precise syntactic changes. The examples in exemplar_selection_knn directly guide the model to produce accurate mutants by showing it what a valid mutation looks like.

2. **Task-Specific Guidance**: Exemplar_selection_knn explicitly instructs the model to apply "small modifications" and provides multiple instances of such modifications, making the task requirements clear. Style_prompting, on the other hand, emphasizes stylistic elements like formality or creativity, which do not directly contribute to the technical correctness or appropriateness of the mutant code. This lack of task-specific guidance leads to less effective mutations.

3. **Consistency in Output**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique ensures consistency by showing the model how to remove or alter specific parts of the code without changing its overall structure. Style_prompting, however, may lead to inconsistent or overly creative outputs (e.g., renaming variables or methods in ways that deviate from the original intent) because it prioritizes style over the technical requirements of mutant generation. This inconsistency reduces the usefulness of the generated mutants for testing purposes.
