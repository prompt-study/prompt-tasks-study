üîç Running test: meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo | Task: assert_generation | Best: exemplar_selection_knn vs Other: emotional_prompting

1. **Contextual Relevance**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique performs better because it selects the most similar code examples to enrich the prompt context, making the model more likely to generate relevant and accurate assertions. This technique provides the model with a clearer understanding of the code's intent and functionality. As a result, the model can produce more appropriate assertions.
2. **Technical Accuracy**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique focuses on the technical aspects of the code, allowing the model to generate assertions that are technically accurate and relevant to the code's functionality. In contrast, emotional_prompting may lead to more generic or irrelevant assertions, as it incorporates affective language that may not be directly related to the code's technical aspects.
3. **Lack of Emotional Bias**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique is less prone to emotional bias, as it relies on the similarity between code examples rather than emotional language. Emotional_prompting, on the other hand, may introduce emotional bias, leading the model to generate assertions that are influenced by the emotional tone of the prompt rather than the technical requirements of the code, resulting in lower-quality responses.
