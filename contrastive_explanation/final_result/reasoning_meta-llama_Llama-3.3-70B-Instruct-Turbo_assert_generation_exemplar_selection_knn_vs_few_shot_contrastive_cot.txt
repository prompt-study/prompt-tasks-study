üîç Running test: meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo | Task: assert_generation | Best: exemplar_selection_knn vs Other: few_shot_contrastive_cot

1. **Contextual Relevance**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique performs better because it selects the most similar code examples to enrich the prompt context, making the model more likely to generate assertions that are relevant to the specific code snippet. This relevance is crucial for assert generation, as the correct assertion depends on the specific logic and variables used in the code. By providing more targeted context, exemplar_selection_knn helps the model produce more accurate assertions.
2. **Code Similarity Awareness**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique is more effective because it takes into account the similarity between code examples, allowing the model to learn from and apply patterns found in similar code snippets. This awareness of code similarity enables the model to generalize better and generate assertions that are more likely to be correct, even for unseen code snippets. In contrast, few_shot_contrastive_cot may not capture these subtle similarities as effectively.
3. **Focused Learning**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique outperforms few_shot_contrastive_cot because it focuses the model's learning on the most relevant and similar code examples, rather than relying on a broader range of correct and incorrect examples. This focused learning approach enables the model to develop a deeper understanding of the specific assert generation task and produce higher-quality assertions, whereas few_shot_contrastive_cot may be distracted by the incorrect examples and produce lower-quality results.
