üîç Running test: meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo | Task: assert_generation | Best: exemplar_selection_knn vs Other: self_ask

1. **Contextual Enrichment**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique performs better because it enriches the prompt context with the most similar code examples, allowing the model to better understand the task and generate more accurate assertions. This contextual enrichment provides the model with a clearer understanding of the code's intent and behavior. As a result, the model can produce more relevant and correct assertions.

2. **Reduced Ambiguity**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique reduces ambiguity in the prompt by providing concrete examples of similar code, which helps the model to focus on the specific task of generating assertions. This reduction in ambiguity enables the model to produce more precise and relevant assertions, rather than generic or incorrect ones. By leveraging similar code examples, the model can better comprehend the task's requirements.

3. **Improved Pattern Recognition**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique enables the model to recognize patterns in the code more effectively, as it is exposed to multiple similar examples. This improved pattern recognition allows the model to identify the key elements and relationships in the code, leading to more accurate and relevant assertions. By recognizing patterns in the code, the model can generate assertions that are more likely to be correct and useful.
