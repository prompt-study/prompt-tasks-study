üîç Running test: meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo | Task: assert_generation | Best: exemplar_selection_knn vs Other: sg_in_context_learning

1. **Contextual Relevance**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique performs better because it selects the most similar code examples to enrich the prompt context, making the provided examples more relevant to the task at hand. This relevance helps the model understand the specific requirements of the assert generation task and generate more accurate assertions. As a result, the model can learn from the most applicable examples and produce higher-quality responses.
2. **Targeted Guidance**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique offers more targeted guidance to the model by providing a set of pre-selected examples that demonstrate the desired assertion generation behavior. This targeted guidance enables the model to focus on the specific patterns and relationships between the code and the assertions, leading to more accurate and relevant responses. In contrast, the sg_in_context_learning technique may provide more general or ambiguous guidance.
3. **Reduced Ambiguity**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique reduces ambiguity in the prompt by providing a clear and concise set of examples that illustrate the expected output. This reduced ambiguity helps the model to better understand the task requirements and generate more precise assertions, whereas the sg_in_context_learning technique may introduce more ambiguity and uncertainty, leading to lower-quality responses.
