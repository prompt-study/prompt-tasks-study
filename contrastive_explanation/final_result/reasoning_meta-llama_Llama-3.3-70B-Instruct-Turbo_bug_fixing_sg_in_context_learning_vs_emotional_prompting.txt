üîç Running test: meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo | Task: bug_fixing | Best: sg_in_context_learning vs Other: emotional_prompting

1. **Contextual Understanding**: The **sg_in_context_learning** technique performs better because it provides the model with a clearer understanding of the context in which the code needs to be fixed. This technique auto-generates in-context examples that simulate few-shot learning, allowing the model to learn from relevant examples and apply that knowledge to the task at hand. As a result, the model can produce more accurate and relevant fixes.
2. **Technical Relevance**: The **sg_in_context_learning** technique is more effective because it focuses on providing technically relevant information and examples, rather than emotional or empathetic language. This allows the model to concentrate on the technical aspects of the task, such as identifying and fixing bugs, and produces more precise and informative responses. In contrast, emotional language may not provide the necessary technical details.
3. **Task-Specific Guidance**: The **sg_in_context_learning** technique offers task-specific guidance that helps the model understand what is expected of it, such as providing a pair of examples depicting 'Problematic Code' and 'Clean Code'. This guidance enables the model to produce responses that are tailored to the specific task of bug fixing, resulting in higher-quality outputs that meet the requirements of the task.
