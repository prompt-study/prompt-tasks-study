üîç Running test: meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo | Task: bug_fixing | Best: sg_in_context_learning vs Other: step_back_prompting

1. **Contextual Understanding**: The sg_in_context_learning technique performs better because it provides the model with contextual examples that simulate few-shot learning, allowing it to understand the specific requirements of the task. This enables the model to generate more accurate and relevant responses. By learning from these examples, the model can develop a deeper understanding of the task's context and nuances.
2. **Targeted Guidance**: The sg_in_context_learning technique offers targeted guidance by providing the model with explicit examples of "Problematic Code" and "Clean Code", which helps the model to focus on the specific aspects of the code that need improvement. This targeted guidance enables the model to generate more effective and efficient solutions. The model can learn from these examples and apply the same principles to new, unseen code.
3. **Specialized Knowledge**: The sg_in_context_learning technique allows the model to acquire specialized knowledge about the task, including the specific coding conventions, best practices, and common pitfalls. By learning from the provided examples, the model can develop a more comprehensive understanding of the task's requirements and generate higher-quality responses that are tailored to the specific needs of the task. This specialized knowledge enables the model to outperform the step_back_prompting technique, which provides more general guidance.
