üîç Running test: meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo | Task: clone_detection | Best: self_ask vs Other: analogical_prompting

1. **Clarification Advantage**: The self_ask technique performs better because it allows for clarification of ambiguities and uncertainties before providing a response. This leads to a more accurate understanding of the task and the code snippets being compared. By asking clarifying questions, the model can ensure it is on the right track before making a determination about code clones.
2. **Task Decomposition**: The self_ask technique enables better task decomposition, breaking down the clone detection task into smaller, manageable parts. This helps the model to focus on specific aspects of the code, such as functionality, structure, and purpose, leading to a more thorough and accurate comparison. By decomposing the task, the model can identify subtle differences or similarities that might be missed with analogical_prompting.
3. **Contextual Understanding**: The self_ask technique provides a deeper contextual understanding of the code snippets, allowing the model to consider the specific context in which the code is being used. This contextual understanding is crucial for accurate clone detection, as it enables the model to recognize nuances and differences that might not be apparent through analogical_prompting alone. By considering the context, the model can make more informed decisions about whether two code snippets are clones or not.
