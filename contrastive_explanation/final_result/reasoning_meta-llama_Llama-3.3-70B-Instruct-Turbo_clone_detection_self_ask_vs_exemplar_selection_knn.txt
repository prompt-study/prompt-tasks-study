1. **Clarification Through Questions**: The self_ask technique performs better because it allows the model to generate clarifying sub-questions before producing the final answer, which enhances problem decomposition and understanding of the task. This leads to more accurate assessments of code similarity. By asking questions, the model can identify potential ambiguities or uncertainties in the code snippets.
2. **Contextual Understanding**: The self_ask technique enables the model to develop a deeper contextual understanding of the code snippets by considering the relationships between different code elements and the overall program structure. This contextual understanding is crucial for accurately identifying clones, as it allows the model to recognize similarities and differences between code snippets. The exemplar_selection_knn technique, on the other hand, relies solely on similarity metrics.
3. **Adaptability to Complexity**: The self_ask technique is more adaptable to complex code snippets and edge cases, as it can ask follow-up questions to clarify specific aspects of the code. This adaptability enables the model to handle a wider range of code snippets and identify clones more accurately, even in cases where the code is complex or contains subtle similarities. In contrast, the exemplar_selection_knn technique may struggle with complex code snippets due to its reliance on pre-defined similarity metrics.
