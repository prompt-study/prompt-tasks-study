1. **Clarification Advantage**: The self_ask technique performs better because it allows the model to generate clarifying sub-questions before producing the final answer, which enhances problem decomposition and understanding. This leads to more accurate analysis of the code snippets and better identification of clones. By asking clarifying questions, the model can ensure it fully comprehends the task.
2. **Contextual Understanding**: The self_ask technique enables the model to consider the context of the code snippets more effectively, including their purpose, structure, and functionality. This contextual understanding is crucial for accurately determining whether two code snippets are clones, as it allows the model to look beyond superficial similarities and focus on the underlying logic and intent.
3. **Adaptive Reasoning**: The self_ask technique facilitates adaptive reasoning by permitting the model to adjust its approach based on the specific characteristics of the code snippets being compared. This adaptability is essential for handling the complexities and nuances of clone detection, where a one-size-fits-all approach may not be effective, and the model needs to be able to respond to the unique features of each code snippet.
