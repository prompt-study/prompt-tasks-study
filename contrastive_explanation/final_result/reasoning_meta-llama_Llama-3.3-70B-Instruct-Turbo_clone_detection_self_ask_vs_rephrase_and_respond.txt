üîç Running test: meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo | Task: clone_detection | Best: self_ask vs Other: rephrase_and_respond

1. **Clarification Through Questions**: The self_ask technique performs better because it allows the model to ask clarifying questions, ensuring a deeper understanding of the task and the code snippets being compared. This leads to more accurate assessments of whether the code snippets are clones. By asking questions, the model can resolve any ambiguities or uncertainties before providing a final answer.
2. **Structured Analysis**: The self_ask technique enables a more structured analysis of the code snippets, as the model breaks down the comparison into smaller, manageable parts, such as checking the programming language, functionality, and code structure. This systematic approach helps the model to identify differences and similarities more effectively. As a result, the model provides more reliable and accurate responses.
3. **Reducing Misinterpretation**: The self_ask technique reduces the likelihood of misinterpreting the task or the code snippets, as the model verifies its understanding through clarifying questions. This helps to prevent incorrect assumptions or misunderstandings that might lead to inaccurate responses. By confirming its understanding, the model can provide more confident and accurate answers, making it a more effective technique for the clone detection task.
