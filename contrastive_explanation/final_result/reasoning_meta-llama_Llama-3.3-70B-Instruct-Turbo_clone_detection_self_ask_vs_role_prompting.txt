üîç Running test: meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo | Task: clone_detection | Best: self_ask vs Other: role_prompting

1. **Clarification Advantage**: The self_ask technique performs better because it allows the model to clarify any ambiguities or uncertainties in the task by generating and answering sub-questions. This process enhances the model's understanding of the task, leading to more accurate responses. By doing so, the model can identify and address potential issues that might affect its performance.
2. **Task Decomposition**: The self_ask technique enables the model to break down the task into smaller, more manageable components, which facilitates a more thorough analysis of the code snippets. This decomposition allows the model to examine each aspect of the code separately, reducing the likelihood of overlooking critical differences or similarities. As a result, the model can provide more reliable and accurate assessments of code similarity.
3. **Contextual Understanding**: The self_ask technique promotes a deeper understanding of the context in which the code snippets are being compared, enabling the model to consider the nuances of the task and the specific requirements of clone detection. By asking and answering clarifying questions, the model can develop a more comprehensive understanding of the task's context, which is essential for accurately identifying clones or near-clones in software code.
