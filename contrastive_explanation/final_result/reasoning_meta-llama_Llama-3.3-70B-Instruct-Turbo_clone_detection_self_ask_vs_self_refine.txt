üîç Running test: meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo | Task: clone_detection | Best: self_ask vs Other: self_refine

1. **Clarification Advantage**: The self_ask technique performs better because it allows for clarification and decomposition of the problem, enabling a more accurate understanding of the task. This leads to a more precise analysis of the code snippets and their potential similarities or differences. By asking clarifying questions, the model can ensure it is on the right track before providing a final answer.
2. **Structured Analysis**: The self_ask technique facilitates a structured approach to analyzing the code snippets, breaking down the comparison into manageable steps and considering various aspects such as functionality, structure, and syntax. This systematic analysis helps to identify subtle differences or similarities that might be overlooked by the self_refine technique. As a result, the self_ask technique provides a more comprehensive evaluation of the code snippets.
3. **Error Mitigation**: The self_ask technique is more effective at mitigating errors by identifying potential pitfalls or ambiguities in the task early on, allowing the model to address them before providing a final response. In contrast, the self_refine technique may refine an initial response that is already flawed, perpetuating errors rather than correcting them. By asking clarifying questions, the self_ask technique can avoid making incorrect assumptions and provide a more reliable answer.
