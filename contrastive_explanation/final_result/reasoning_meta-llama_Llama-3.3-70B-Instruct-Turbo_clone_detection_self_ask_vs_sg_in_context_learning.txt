1. **Clarification Through Sub-Questions**: The self_ask technique performs better because it allows the model to generate clarifying sub-questions, which helps in decomposing the problem into smaller, more manageable parts. This process enables the model to understand the task of clone detection more accurately and make a more informed decision. By doing so, it can identify subtle differences or similarities between code snippets that might be overlooked by other techniques.

2. **Contextual Understanding**: The self_ask technique enables the model to develop a deeper contextual understanding of the code snippets being compared. By asking and answering its own questions, the model can delve into the specifics of the code, such as functionality, structure, and syntax, allowing for a more nuanced comparison. This contextual understanding is crucial for accurately identifying clones, as it considers not just the surface-level similarities but also the underlying logic and purpose of the code.

3. **Adaptability to Complexity**: The self_ask technique is more adaptable to complex code comparison tasks because it can iteratively refine its understanding of the problem through self-generated questions. This adaptability is particularly important in clone detection, where code snippets can vary significantly in complexity, length, and purpose. By being able to ask follow-up questions, the model can navigate these complexities more effectively, leading to more accurate assessments of whether two pieces of code are clones or not.
