1. **Clarification Through Inquiry**: The self_ask technique performs better because it allows the model to clarify any ambiguities or uncertainties through additional questions, ensuring a more accurate understanding of the task. This leads to a more precise analysis of the code snippets and a more reliable determination of whether they are clones. By asking and answering these questions, the model can refine its understanding and provide a more confident response.
2. **Task Decomposition**: The self_ask technique enables the model to break down the task into smaller, more manageable components, analyzing each part of the code snippets separately and systematically. This decomposition helps the model to identify subtle differences or similarities between the snippets, leading to a more accurate assessment of their cloneness. By decomposing the task, the model can focus on specific aspects of the code and make a more informed decision.
3. **Contextual Understanding**: The self_ask technique allows the model to develop a deeper contextual understanding of the code snippets by considering the specific details and nuances of each snippet. By asking and answering questions, the model can gather more information about the code's purpose, structure, and functionality, enabling it to make a more informed decision about whether the snippets are clones. This contextual understanding is essential for accurately identifying cloned code, as it requires a thorough comprehension of the code's intricacies and subtleties.
