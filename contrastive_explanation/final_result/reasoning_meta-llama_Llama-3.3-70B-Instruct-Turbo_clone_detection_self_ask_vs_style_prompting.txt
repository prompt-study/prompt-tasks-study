üîç Running test: meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo | Task: clone_detection | Best: self_ask vs Other: style_prompting

1. **Clarification Advantage**: The self_ask technique performs better because it allows for clarification and decomposition of the problem, ensuring that all aspects of the task are understood before providing a response. This leads to more accurate and relevant answers, as the model can identify and address any ambiguities or uncertainties. By doing so, it enhances the overall quality of the response.
2. **Contextual Understanding**: The self_ask technique enables the model to develop a deeper contextual understanding of the task by prompting it to ask clarifying questions, which helps in identifying the key elements and nuances of the problem. This contextual understanding is crucial for tasks like clone detection, where subtle differences in code functionality or structure can significantly impact the outcome. As a result, the model can provide more informed and accurate responses.
3. **Analytical Depth**: The self_ask technique promotes a more analytical approach by encouraging the model to break down the problem into smaller, manageable parts, and to consider multiple factors before reaching a conclusion. This analytical depth is essential for clone detection, as it requires a thorough examination of the code's functionality, structure, and syntax to determine whether two code snippets are clones or not. By fostering this analytical approach, the self_ask technique leads to more comprehensive and accurate responses.
