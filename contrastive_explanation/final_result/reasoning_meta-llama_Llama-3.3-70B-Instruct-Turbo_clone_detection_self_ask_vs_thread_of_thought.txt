üîç Running test: meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo | Task: clone_detection | Best: self_ask vs Other: thread_of_thought

1. **Clarification Focus**: The self_ask technique performs better because it focuses on clarifying the task details before providing an answer, which helps to ensure that the response is accurate and relevant. This approach allows the model to identify potential ambiguities and address them before proceeding. By doing so, it increases the chances of providing a correct response.
2. **Task Decomposition**: The self_ask technique enables better task decomposition, which is essential for complex tasks like clone detection. By breaking down the task into smaller, manageable parts, the model can analyze each component separately and provide a more comprehensive response. This decomposition helps to identify the key differences or similarities between the code snippets.
3. **Contextual Understanding**: The self_ask technique promotes a deeper contextual understanding of the task, allowing the model to consider the specific requirements and constraints of the clone detection task. This understanding enables the model to provide more accurate and relevant responses, as it can take into account the nuances of the task and the characteristics of the code snippets being compared.
