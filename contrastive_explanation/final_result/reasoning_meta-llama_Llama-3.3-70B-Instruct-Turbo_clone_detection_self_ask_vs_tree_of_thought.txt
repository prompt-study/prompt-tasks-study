üîç Running test: meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo | Task: clone_detection | Best: self_ask vs Other: tree_of_thought

1. **Clarification Focus**: The self_ask technique performs better because it focuses on clarifying ambiguities and asking relevant questions before providing an answer, which is particularly useful in clone detection tasks where understanding the code's functionality and structure is crucial. This approach ensures that the model addresses the task with a clear understanding of the requirements. By doing so, it can provide more accurate responses.

2. **Direct Problem Addressal**: The self_ask technique directly addresses the problem at hand by identifying the need for clarification and then proceeding to analyze the code snippets based on that clarification. This direct approach allows the model to stay focused on the key aspects of the task, such as comparing the functionality and structure of the code snippets. As a result, it can more effectively determine whether the snippets are clones.

3. **Efficient Analysis Path**: The self_ask technique leads to a more efficient analysis path because it prompts the model to consider what it needs to know to answer the question accurately before diving into complex reasoning processes. This efficiency in identifying the necessary steps for analysis enables the model to avoid unnecessary iterations and directly reach a conclusion based on the essential characteristics of the code snippets. Consequently, it can provide a more straightforward and accurate answer to whether the code snippets are clones.
