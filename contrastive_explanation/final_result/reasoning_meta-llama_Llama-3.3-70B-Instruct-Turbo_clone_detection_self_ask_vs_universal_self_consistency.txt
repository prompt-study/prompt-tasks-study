üîç Running test: meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo | Task: clone_detection | Best: self_ask vs Other: universal_self_consistency

1. **Clarification Through Questions**: The self_ask technique performs better because it allows for clarification through questions, ensuring that the model understands the task requirements accurately before providing a response. This leads to more precise and relevant answers, as seen in the examples where the self_ask technique helped identify the correct clones. By asking clarifying questions, the model can avoid misunderstandings and provide more accurate results.
2. **Task Decomposition**: The self_ask technique enables effective task decomposition, breaking down complex tasks into smaller, manageable parts, which helps in identifying clones more accurately. This decomposition allows the model to analyze each part of the code snippets separately, leading to a more thorough understanding of their functionality and structure. As a result, the self_ask technique can identify clones more reliably than the universal_self_consistency technique.
3. **Contextual Understanding**: The self_ask technique provides a deeper contextual understanding of the task, enabling the model to consider the specific requirements and nuances of clone detection. By asking questions and seeking clarification, the model can develop a more comprehensive understanding of the code snippets and their purposes, leading to more accurate clone detection results. This contextual understanding is essential for identifying clones correctly, as it allows the model to recognize subtle differences and similarities between code snippets.
