üîç Running test: meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo | Task: code_generation | Best: sg_in_context_learning vs Other: analogical_prompting

1. **Contextual Understanding**: The **sg_in_context_learning** technique performs better because it provides a clearer understanding of the context in which the code is being generated. This technique allows the model to learn from examples and generate code that is more relevant to the specific task at hand. As a result, the generated code is more accurate and effective.
2. **Task-Specific Guidance**: The **sg_in_context_learning** technique offers more task-specific guidance, enabling the model to focus on the particular requirements of the task. By providing examples and context, this technique helps the model to better comprehend the task's objectives and generate code that meets those objectives. This targeted approach leads to more precise and relevant code generation.
3. **Few-Shot Learning Capability**: The **sg_in_context_learning** technique leverages few-shot learning, which enables the model to learn from a limited number of examples and generate code that is more adaptable to new, unseen tasks. This capability allows the model to generalize better and produce higher-quality code, even when faced with novel or complex tasks, making it more effective than the **analogical_prompting** technique.
