üîç Running test: meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo | Task: code_generation | Best: sg_in_context_learning vs Other: emotional_prompting

1. **Task Relevance**: The **sg_in_context_learning** technique performs better because it is more relevant to the task of code generation, as it provides a clear and concise description of the task and the expected output. This technique allows the model to understand the context and generate code that meets the requirements. The **emotional_prompting** technique, on the other hand, incorporates affective language that may not be directly relevant to the task.
2. **Code Structure**: The **sg_in_context_learning** technique generates code with a clearer structure and organization, making it easier to understand and maintain. This is because the technique provides a clear description of the task and the expected output, allowing the model to generate code that is well-organized and concise. In contrast, the **emotional_prompting** technique may generate code that is less organized and more difficult to understand.
3. **Technical Accuracy**: The **sg_in_context_learning** technique generates code that is more technically accurate and consistent with the requirements of the task. This is because the technique provides a clear and concise description of the task, allowing the model to generate code that is accurate and consistent with the requirements. The **emotional_prompting** technique, on the other hand, may generate code that contains errors or inconsistencies due to the incorporation of affective language.
