üîç Running test: meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo | Task: code_generation | Best: sg_in_context_learning vs Other: few_shot_contrastive_cot

1. **Contextual Understanding**: The **sg_in_context_learning** technique performs better because it auto-generates in-context examples that simulate few-shot learning, allowing the model to develop a deeper understanding of the task context. This enables the model to generate more accurate and relevant code. By learning from these examples, the model can better comprehend the nuances of the task.
2. **Adaptability to Task Requirements**: The **sg_in_context_learning** technique is more adaptable to the specific requirements of the task, as it can generate examples that are tailored to the task's needs. This adaptability enables the model to produce code that is more closely aligned with the task's objectives, resulting in better performance. In contrast, **few_shot_contrastive_cot** may not be able to adapt as effectively to the task's requirements.
3. **Improved Code Generation**: The **sg_in_context_learning** technique leads to improved code generation capabilities due to its ability to learn from generated examples that are relevant to the task. This allows the model to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the code structures and patterns required for the task, resulting in more accurate and effective code generation. As a result, the **sg_in_context_learning** technique outperforms **few_shot_contrastive_cot** in terms of code generation quality.
