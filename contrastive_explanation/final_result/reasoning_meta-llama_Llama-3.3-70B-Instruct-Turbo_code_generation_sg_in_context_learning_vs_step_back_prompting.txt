üîç Running test: meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo | Task: code_generation | Best: sg_in_context_learning vs Other: step_back_prompting

1. **Contextual Understanding**: The **sg_in_context_learning** technique performs better because it provides a deeper understanding of the context in which the code is being generated. This allows the model to learn from the provided examples and generate more accurate code. By simulating few-shot learning, the model can adapt to the specific requirements of the task.
2. **Task-Specific Adaptation**: The **sg_in_context_learning** technique enables the model to adapt to the specific task at hand, taking into account the unique requirements and constraints of the problem. This adaptation allows the model to generate code that is more tailored to the task, resulting in better performance. In contrast, **step_back_prompting** may not provide the same level of task-specific adaptation.
3. **Example-Based Learning**: The **sg_in_context_learning** technique leverages example-based learning, where the model learns from the provided examples to generate new code. This approach enables the model to capture the nuances of the task and generate code that is more consistent with the examples. In contrast, **step_back_prompting** may rely more on general knowledge and high-level planning, which may not be as effective for generating accurate code.
