üîç Running test: meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo | Task: code_question_answering | Best: universal_self_consistency vs Other: emotional_prompting

1. **Clear Objective**: The universal_self_consistency technique performs better because it provides a clear and direct objective for the model to evaluate the code snippet and determine if it fully answers the question. This clarity allows the model to focus on the specific requirements of the task without being distracted by emotional language. As a result, the model can provide more accurate and relevant responses.
2. **Technical Relevance**: The universal_self_consistency technique is more effective because it uses technical and relevant language that is closely related to the task of code analysis and evaluation. This technical language helps the model to understand the context and requirements of the task more accurately, leading to better performance and more reliable responses.
3. **Lack of Emotional Bias**: The universal_self_consistency technique outperforms emotional_prompting because it avoids introducing emotional bias into the model's responses. Emotional language can sometimes lead to biased or misleading responses, whereas the universal_self_consistency technique provides a more neutral and objective framework for evaluation, resulting in more trustworthy and accurate outputs.
