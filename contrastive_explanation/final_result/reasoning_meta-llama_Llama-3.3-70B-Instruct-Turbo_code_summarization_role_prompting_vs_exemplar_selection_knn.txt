üîç Running test: meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo | Task: code_summarization | Best: role_prompting vs Other: exemplar_selection_knn

1. **Contextual Understanding**: The role_prompting technique performs better because it provides a clear context for the model to understand the task, allowing it to generate more accurate and relevant summaries. By assigning a specific role, such as "Algorithm Designer" or "Software Developer", the model can tailor its response to the task's requirements. This contextual understanding enables the model to produce higher-quality summaries.
2. **Focused Prompting**: Role_prompting offers a more focused prompting approach, which helps the model to concentrate on the specific task of code summarization. Unlike exemplar_selection_knn, which relies on selecting similar code examples, role_prompting provides a direct and concise prompt that guides the model's response. This focused prompting leads to more precise and relevant summaries.
3. **Domain Knowledge Alignment**: The role_prompting technique aligns the model's response with the domain knowledge and expertise associated with the assigned role. By adopting the perspective of a specific role, the model can leverage its knowledge of software development concepts, terminology, and best practices to generate summaries that are more informative and accurate. This alignment of domain knowledge enables the model to produce higher-quality summaries that better meet the task's requirements.
