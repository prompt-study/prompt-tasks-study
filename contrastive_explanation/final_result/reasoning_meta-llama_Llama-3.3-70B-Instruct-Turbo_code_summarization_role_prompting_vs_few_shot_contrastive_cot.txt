üîç Running test: meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo | Task: code_summarization | Best: role_prompting vs Other: few_shot_contrastive_cot

1. **Contextual Understanding**: The role_prompting technique performs better because it provides a clear context for the model to understand the task, allowing it to generate more accurate and relevant summaries. By assigning a specific role, such as "Algorithm Designer" or "Software Developer", the model can tailor its response to the task's requirements. This contextual understanding enables the model to produce higher-quality summaries.
2. **Focused Response**: Role_prompting leads to more focused responses because it guides the model to provide only the necessary information, without including unnecessary details or examples. This focused approach results in more concise and clear summaries, which are better suited for the task of code summarization. In contrast, few_shot_contrastive_cot may produce longer, more verbose responses.
3. **Domain Knowledge Alignment**: The role_prompting technique aligns the model's response with the domain knowledge required for the task, as the assigned role implies a certain level of expertise and understanding of the subject matter. This alignment enables the model to generate summaries that are more accurate and relevant to the code being summarized, resulting in higher evaluation scores.
