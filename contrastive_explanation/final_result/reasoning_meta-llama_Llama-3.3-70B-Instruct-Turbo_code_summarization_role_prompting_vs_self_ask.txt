üîç Running test: meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo | Task: code_summarization | Best: role_prompting vs Other: self_ask

1. **Clear Role Definition**: The role_prompting technique performs better because it clearly defines the role of the model, such as "Algorithm Designer" or "Senior Software Engineer", which helps the model to understand the context and tone of the response. This clear definition enables the model to generate more accurate and relevant summaries. As a result, the model's responses are more concise and directly related to the code snippet.
2. **Focused Response Generation**: Role_prompting leads to better performance because it guides the model to generate responses that are focused on the specific task at hand, which is code summarization. By assigning a specific role, the model is more likely to produce a summary that is relevant and concise, without feeling the need to ask clarifying questions or provide unnecessary details. This focused approach results in higher-quality summaries.
3. **Reduced Ambiguity**: The role_prompting technique reduces ambiguity in the model's response generation process, as the assigned role provides a clear understanding of the expected output and tone. In contrast, the self_ask technique may introduce ambiguity by encouraging the model to ask questions and provide lengthy explanations, which can lead to lower-quality summaries. By minimizing ambiguity, role_prompting enables the model to produce more accurate and effective summaries.
