üîç Running test: meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo | Task: code_summarization | Best: role_prompting vs Other: step_back_prompting

1. **Clear Direction**: The role_prompting technique performs better because it provides a clear direction and context for the model to generate a summary. By assigning a specific role, such as "Algorithm Designer" or "DevOps Engineer", the model is able to tailor its response to the task and provide a more accurate summary. This clear direction helps the model to focus on the key aspects of the code.
2. **Domain Knowledge**: Role_prompting allows the model to leverage domain-specific knowledge and terminology associated with the assigned role, resulting in more precise and relevant summaries. This technique enables the model to use its understanding of the domain to identify the most important aspects of the code and generate a summary that is concise and informative. The use of domain-specific knowledge improves the overall quality of the summary.
3. **Focused Communication**: The role_prompting technique promotes focused communication by encouraging the model to adopt the communication style and tone of the assigned role. This helps the model to avoid unnecessary details and provide a summary that is directly relevant to the task, resulting in higher evaluation scores and better performance compared to the step_back_prompting technique. The focused communication style of role_prompting enables the model to deliver concise and accurate summaries.
