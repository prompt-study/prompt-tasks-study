üîç Running test: meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo | Task: code_translation | Best: exemplar_selection_knn vs Other: few_shot_contrastive_cot

1. **Contextual Understanding**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique performs better because it provides the model with relevant code examples that help it understand the context of the translation task. This contextual understanding enables the model to make more accurate translations. By leveraging similar code examples, the model can better comprehend the nuances of the source and target languages.
2. **Idiomatic Expression**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique allows the model to learn idiomatic expressions and language-specific constructs, which is crucial for accurate code translation. By exposing the model to multiple examples of correct translations, it can develop a sense of what constitutes idiomatic code in the target language. This enables the model to produce more natural and readable translations.
3. **Semantic Preservation**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique helps the model preserve the semantics of the original code, which is essential for code translation tasks. By analyzing multiple examples of correct translations, the model can identify the key elements that need to be preserved during translation, such as variable names, function signatures, and control structures. This ensures that the translated code behaves as intended and maintains the same functionality as the original code.
