üîç Running test: meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo | Task: code_translation | Best: exemplar_selection_knn vs Other: role_prompting

1. **Contextual Enrichment**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique performs better because it enriches the prompt context with similar code examples, allowing the model to learn from these examples and generate more accurate translations. This approach provides the model with a clearer understanding of the code's structure and syntax. As a result, the model can produce higher-quality translations.
2. **Syntax Awareness**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique helps the model develop a better awareness of the syntax and semantics of the source and target programming languages. By analyzing the provided examples, the model can identify patterns and relationships between the languages, enabling it to generate more accurate and idiomatic translations. This syntax awareness is crucial for producing high-quality code translations.
3. **Lack of Role Bias**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique is not influenced by role-based biases, which can occur when using the role_prompting technique. When a model is assigned a specific role, such as a developer or reviewer, it may introduce biases or assumptions that can affect the translation quality. In contrast, the exemplar_selection_knn technique focuses solely on the code examples, allowing the model to generate translations based on the code's characteristics rather than a predetermined role or persona.
