üîç Running test: meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo | Task: code_translation | Best: exemplar_selection_knn vs Other: sg_in_context_learning

1. **Contextual Relevance**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique performs better because it selects the most similar code examples to enrich the prompt context, making the model more likely to generate accurate translations. This relevance in context helps the model understand the nuances of the code and translate it correctly. As a result, the model produces higher-quality responses.
2. **Targeted Guidance**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique provides targeted guidance to the model by offering specific, relevant examples that demonstrate the desired translation behavior. This guidance enables the model to learn from the examples and apply that knowledge to generate accurate translations, whereas the sg_in_context_learning technique may not provide the same level of targeted guidance.
3. **Semantic Preservation**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique is better at preserving the semantics of the original code, as it uses similar code examples to inform the translation process. This helps the model to maintain the original code's intent, structure, and behavior, resulting in more accurate and reliable translations, whereas the sg_in_context_learning technique may struggle to preserve the semantics of the original code.
