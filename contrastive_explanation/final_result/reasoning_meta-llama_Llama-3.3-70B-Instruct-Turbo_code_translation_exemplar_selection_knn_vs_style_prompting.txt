üîç Running test: meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo | Task: code_translation | Best: exemplar_selection_knn vs Other: style_prompting

1. **Contextual Understanding**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique performs better because it provides the model with a set of similar code examples, allowing it to understand the context and nuances of the code translation task. This contextual understanding enables the model to generate more accurate translations. By leveraging these examples, the model can learn to recognize patterns and relationships between code snippets.
2. **Semantic Preservation**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique helps preserve the semantics of the original code by providing examples that demonstrate how to translate specific code constructs and syntax from one language to another. This ensures that the translated code maintains its original meaning and functionality, resulting in higher-quality translations. The model can learn to identify and apply these semantic preservation rules from the provided examples.
3. **Syntax and Structure Guidance**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique offers guidance on syntax and structure by showcasing how to translate code from one language to another, including differences in naming conventions, syntax, and coding standards. This guidance enables the model to generate translated code that is not only functionally correct but also syntactically accurate and consistent with the target language's conventions, leading to better evaluation scores.
