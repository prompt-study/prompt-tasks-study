üîç Running test: meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo | Task: exception_type | Best: exemplar_selection_knn vs Other: analogical_prompting

1. **Contextual Relevance**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique performs better because it selects the most similar code examples to enrich the prompt context, making the model more likely to understand the specific requirements of the task. This contextual relevance allows the model to provide more accurate responses. By leveraging similar code examples, the model can better comprehend the nuances of the task.

2. **Code-Specific Knowledge**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique outperforms analogical_prompting because it focuses on code-specific knowledge, which is essential for identifying the correct exception type. By analyzing similar code examples, the model can gain a deeper understanding of how exceptions are handled in specific coding contexts. This code-specific knowledge enables the model to provide more accurate and relevant responses.

3. **Reducing Ambiguity**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique reduces ambiguity in the prompt by providing concrete code examples, which helps the model to better understand the task requirements. In contrast, analogical_prompting may introduce ambiguity by relying on abstract analogies, which can lead to incorrect interpretations. By minimizing ambiguity, the exemplar_selection_knn technique enables the model to provide more accurate and reliable responses.
