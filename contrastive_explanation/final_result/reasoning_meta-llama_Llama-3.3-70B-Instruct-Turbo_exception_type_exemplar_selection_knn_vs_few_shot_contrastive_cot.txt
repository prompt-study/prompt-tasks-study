üîç Running test: meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo | Task: exception_type | Best: exemplar_selection_knn vs Other: few_shot_contrastive_cot

1. **Contextual Relevance**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique performs better because it selects the most similar code examples to enrich the prompt context, making the model's response more relevant to the specific task of exception type prediction. This relevance is crucial for accurately identifying the correct exception type in a given code snippet. By focusing on similar examples, the model can better understand the context and make more informed predictions.

2. **Specialized Knowledge Retrieval**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique allows for more specialized knowledge retrieval, as it focuses on the most similar code examples. This specialization enables the model to access and utilize knowledge that is directly applicable to the task at hand, leading to more accurate predictions of exception types. In contrast, the few_shot_contrastive_cot technique may introduce more general or less relevant information.

3. **Reduced Ambiguity**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique reduces ambiguity in the model's responses by providing a clearer and more direct context for the task. By selecting the most similar code examples, the technique helps the model to focus on the specific aspects of the code that are relevant to exception type prediction, reducing the likelihood of confusion or misinterpretation. This clarity and focus contribute to the technique's superior performance compared to the few_shot_contrastive_cot technique.
