üîç Running test: meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo | Task: exception_type | Best: exemplar_selection_knn vs Other: role_prompting

1. **Contextual Relevance**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique performs better because it selects the most similar code examples to enrich the prompt context, making the model more aware of the specific coding scenario and its exceptions. This relevance helps the model to provide more accurate exception type predictions. By leveraging similar code examples, the technique enhances the model's understanding of the context in which the exception occurs.
2. **Code-Specific Knowledge**: Exemplar_selection_knn outperforms role_prompting due to its ability to tap into code-specific knowledge by analyzing similar code snippets. This allows the model to learn from existing code examples and identify patterns related to exception handling, leading to more accurate predictions. The technique's focus on code-specific knowledge enables it to better comprehend the nuances of exception types in different coding contexts.
3. **Data-Driven Approach**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique adopts a data-driven approach by relying on actual code examples to inform its predictions, whereas role_prompting relies on predefined roles and personas. This data-driven approach enables the model to learn from a wide range of coding scenarios and exception types, making it more effective at predicting the correct exception type in a given context. By leveraging real-world code examples, the technique can capture complex relationships between code and exceptions that might be missed by role_prompting.
