üîç Running test: meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo | Task: exception_type | Best: exemplar_selection_knn vs Other: self_ask

1. **Contextual Relevance**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique performs better because it selects the most similar code examples to enrich the prompt context, making the model more likely to generate accurate responses. This technique ensures that the model is trained on relevant and related code examples, which improves its ability to identify the correct exception type. By leveraging similar code examples, the model can better understand the context and generate more accurate responses.
2. **Knowledge Retrieval**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique outperforms self_ask because it can retrieve relevant knowledge from similar code examples, allowing the model to make more informed decisions. This technique enables the model to access a broader range of information, which is particularly useful for exception type prediction tasks that require a deep understanding of programming concepts and error handling mechanisms. By retrieving relevant knowledge, the model can generate more accurate and informative responses.
3. **Reducing Ambiguity**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique is more effective than self_ask because it helps reduce ambiguity in the prompt by providing the model with concrete code examples to work with. This technique minimizes the need for clarifying questions and reduces the likelihood of misinterpretation, allowing the model to focus on generating accurate responses. By providing clear and relevant context, the exemplar_selection_knn technique enables the model to produce more accurate and reliable outputs.
