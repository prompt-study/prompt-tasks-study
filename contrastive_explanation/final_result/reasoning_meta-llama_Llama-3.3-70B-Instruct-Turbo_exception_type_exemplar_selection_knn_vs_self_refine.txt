üîç Running test: meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo | Task: exception_type | Best: exemplar_selection_knn vs Other: self_refine

1. **Contextual Understanding**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique performs better because it selects the most similar code examples to enrich the prompt context, allowing for a deeper understanding of the code's behavior and intent. This contextual understanding enables the model to make more accurate predictions about the exception type. By considering multiple relevant examples, the model can identify patterns and relationships that might not be apparent from a single example or through self-refinement alone.
2. **Knowledge Retrieval**: Exemplar_selection_knn technique excels at retrieving relevant knowledge from a large pool of code examples, which is crucial for exception type prediction. This technique can fetch examples that have similar exception handling mechanisms, providing the model with a broader knowledge base to make predictions. In contrast, self_refine might get stuck in local optima or overfit to a specific example, lacking the diversity of knowledge that exemplar_selection_knn offers.
3. **Robustness to Noise**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique is more robust to noise and outliers in the data because it relies on the collective information from multiple examples. This makes it less susceptible to errors or biases present in individual examples, which can mislead the self_refine technique. By aggregating information from several sources, exemplar_selection_knn can filter out noise and focus on the essential patterns and relationships that indicate the correct exception type.
