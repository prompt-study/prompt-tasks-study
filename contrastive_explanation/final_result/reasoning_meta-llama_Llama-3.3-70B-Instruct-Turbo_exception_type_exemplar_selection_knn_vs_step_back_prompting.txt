üîç Running test: meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo | Task: exception_type | Best: exemplar_selection_knn vs Other: step_back_prompting

1. **Contextual Relevance**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique performs better because it selects the most similar code examples to enrich the prompt context, making the model's response more relevant to the specific task of exception type prediction. This technique provides the model with a more focused and relevant set of examples to learn from, leading to more accurate predictions. By leveraging similar code examples, the model can better understand the context and nuances of the task.

2. **Specialized Knowledge**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique outperforms step_back_prompting because it allows the model to tap into a specialized knowledge base of code examples that are directly related to exception handling. This enables the model to develop a deeper understanding of the specific exception types and their corresponding contexts, resulting in more accurate predictions. By focusing on a specific domain of knowledge, the model can develop a more refined and accurate understanding of exception type prediction.

3. **Granular Understanding**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique excels because it provides the model with a granular understanding of the task by exposing it to a diverse set of code examples that illustrate various exception handling scenarios. This granular understanding enables the model to recognize subtle patterns and relationships between code elements and exception types, leading to more accurate predictions. By analyzing a wide range of code examples, the model can develop a more nuanced and detailed understanding of exception type prediction, allowing it to perform better than the step_back_prompting technique.
