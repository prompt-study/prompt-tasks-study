üîç Running test: meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo | Task: exception_type | Best: exemplar_selection_knn vs Other: style_prompting

1. **Contextual Relevance**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique performs better because it selects the most similar code examples to enrich the prompt context, making the model more aware of the specific coding scenario and its exceptions. This contextual relevance allows the model to provide more accurate exception type predictions. By leveraging similar code examples, the model can better understand the nuances of the code and identify the correct exception type.

2. **Code-Specific Knowledge**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique outperforms style_prompting because it focuses on code-specific knowledge and exceptions, rather than just adopting a specific tone or format. This code-specific knowledge enables the model to recognize patterns and relationships between code elements and their corresponding exceptions, leading to more accurate predictions. By emphasizing code-specific knowledge, the model can develop a deeper understanding of the programming concepts and exceptions.

3. **Exception-Specific Insights**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique excels because it provides exception-specific insights by analyzing similar code examples and their associated exceptions. This analysis allows the model to gain a deeper understanding of the exceptions that can occur in specific coding scenarios, enabling it to make more informed predictions. By leveraging these exception-specific insights, the model can recognize the correct exception type and provide more accurate responses.
