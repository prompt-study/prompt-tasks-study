üîç Running test: meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo | Task: exception_type | Best: exemplar_selection_knn vs Other: thread_of_thought

1. **Contextual Relevance**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique performs better because it selects the most similar code examples to enrich the prompt context, making the model more likely to generate accurate responses. This technique ensures that the model is trained on relevant and related code examples, which improves its ability to identify the correct exception type. By leveraging similar code examples, the model can better understand the context and behavior of the code.
2. **Focused Learning**: Exemplar_selection_knn allows the model to focus on the specific task of exception type identification by providing it with a curated set of relevant code examples. This focused learning approach enables the model to develop a deeper understanding of the relationships between code structures and exception types, leading to more accurate predictions. By concentrating on the most relevant examples, the model can learn to recognize patterns and relationships that are critical to exception type identification.
3. **Reduced Ambiguity**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique reduces ambiguity in the model's responses by providing a clear and concise set of examples that illustrate the correct exception type. This clarity helps the model to avoid confusion and misinterpretation, which can occur when using more open-ended techniques like thread_of_thought. By minimizing ambiguity, the exemplar_selection_knn technique enables the model to generate more confident and accurate responses, which is critical for exception type identification tasks.
