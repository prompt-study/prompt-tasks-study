üîç Running test: meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo | Task: exception_type | Best: exemplar_selection_knn vs Other: tree_of_thought

1. **Contextual Relevance**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique performs better because it selects the most similar code examples to enrich the prompt context, making the model's response more relevant to the specific task of exception type prediction. This relevance is crucial for accurately identifying the correct exception type in a given code snippet. By focusing on similar examples, the model can learn from directly applicable instances.

2. **Focused Learning**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique allows the model to learn from a focused set of examples that are closely related to the task at hand, which enhances its ability to recognize patterns and relationships specific to exception type prediction. This focused learning approach enables the model to develop a deeper understanding of the exceptions and their contexts, leading to more accurate predictions. It contrasts with the broader, more exploratory nature of the tree_of_thought technique.

3. **Efficient Generalization**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique facilitates efficient generalization by providing the model with a curated set of relevant examples, allowing it to generalize more effectively to new, unseen code snippets. This efficient generalization is key to the model's performance on the exception type prediction task, as it enables the model to apply what it has learned from similar examples to predict the correct exception type in novel situations.
