üîç Running test: meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo | Task: exception_type | Best: exemplar_selection_knn vs Other: universal_self_consistency

1. **Contextual Relevance**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique performs better because it selects the most similar code examples to enrich the prompt context, making the model more likely to understand the specific requirements of the task. This relevance in context helps the model to generate more accurate responses. By focusing on similar code examples, the technique enhances the model's ability to identify the correct exception type.

2. **Specialized Knowledge Retrieval**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique excels at retrieving specialized knowledge relevant to the task at hand, which is crucial for identifying exception types in software engineering tasks. This technique's ability to find and utilize relevant examples allows the model to access a broader range of exception types and their usage contexts. As a result, the model can provide more accurate and task-specific responses.

3. **Reduced Ambiguity**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique reduces ambiguity in the model's responses by providing a clearer and more direct context for the task. By leveraging similar code examples, the technique helps the model to better understand the nuances of exception handling in specific coding scenarios, leading to more precise and relevant responses. This reduction in ambiguity is key to the technique's superior performance in identifying the correct exception types.
