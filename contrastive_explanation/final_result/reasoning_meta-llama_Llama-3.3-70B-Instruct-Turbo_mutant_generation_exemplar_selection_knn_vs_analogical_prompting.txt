üîç Running test: meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo | Task: mutant_generation | Best: exemplar_selection_knn vs Other: analogical_prompting

1. **Contextual Relevance**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique performs better because it selects the most similar code examples to enrich the prompt context, making it more relevant to the task of mutant generation. This relevance helps the model understand the specific requirements and nuances of the task, leading to more accurate responses. As a result, the model can generate higher-quality mutants that meet the task's criteria.
2. **Code-Specific Guidance**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique provides code-specific guidance by offering examples of modified code, which helps the model learn the patterns and structures of effective mutant generation. This guidance enables the model to produce mutants that are syntactically correct and semantically altered, as required by the task. In contrast, analogical_prompting may not provide sufficient code-specific guidance, leading to lower-quality responses.
3. **Reduced Ambiguity**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique reduces ambiguity in the prompt by providing clear examples of input and output code, which helps the model understand the task's requirements and expectations. This reduced ambiguity enables the model to generate mutants that are more accurate and relevant to the task, whereas analogical_prompting may introduce ambiguity and uncertainty, leading to lower-quality responses and lower evaluation scores.
