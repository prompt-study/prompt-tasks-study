üîç Running test: meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo | Task: mutant_generation | Best: exemplar_selection_knn vs Other: emotional_prompting

1. **Contextual Relevance**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique performs better because it selects the most similar code examples to enrich the prompt context, making it more relevant to the task of mutant generation. This relevance helps the model understand the subtle modifications required to create a mutant. As a result, the model can generate more accurate and context-specific responses.
2. **Technical Precision**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique focuses on technical aspects of the code, allowing the model to generate mutants with precise and minimal modifications. In contrast, emotional_prompting introduces affective language that may distract from the technical requirements of the task, leading to less precise and less relevant responses.
3. **Lack of Emotional Noise**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique avoids introducing emotional noise into the prompt, which can confuse the model and lead to poor performance. Emotional_prompting, on the other hand, incorporates affective language that may add noise to the prompt, causing the model to generate responses that are not tailored to the specific requirements of the mutant generation task.
