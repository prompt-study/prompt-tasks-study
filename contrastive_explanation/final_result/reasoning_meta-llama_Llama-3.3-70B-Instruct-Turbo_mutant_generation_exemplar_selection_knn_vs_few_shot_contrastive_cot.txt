1. **Contextual Similarity**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique performs better because it selects the most similar code examples to enrich the prompt context, allowing the model to generate mutants that are more relevant and accurate. This similarity-based approach helps the model understand the code's structure and intent, leading to higher-quality mutants. By leveraging similar code examples, the model can make more informed decisions about where and how to introduce mutations.
2. **Focused Mutation**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique enables the model to focus on specific parts of the code that are similar to the examples provided, allowing for more targeted and subtle mutations. This focused approach helps the model avoid introducing arbitrary or unnecessary changes, resulting in mutants that are more likely to be valid and useful. By concentrating on specific areas of the code, the model can create mutants that are more relevant to the original code's functionality.
3. **Syntactic Consistency**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique promotes syntactic consistency by drawing from a set of similar code examples, which helps the model generate mutants that are not only semantically altered but also syntactically correct. This consistency is crucial for ensuring that the generated mutants are valid and can be compiled or executed without errors. By maintaining syntactic consistency, the exemplar_selection_knn technique enables the model to produce higher-quality mutants that are more useful for testing and analysis purposes.
