üîç Running test: meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo | Task: mutant_generation | Best: exemplar_selection_knn vs Other: role_prompting

1. **Contextual Relevance**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique performs better because it selects the most similar code examples to enrich the prompt context, making the model more likely to generate relevant and accurate mutants. This approach provides the model with a clearer understanding of the task requirements and the types of changes that are expected. As a result, the model can produce higher-quality mutants that meet the task's standards.
2. **Focused Guidance**: Exemplar_selection_knn offers more focused guidance to the model by providing concrete examples of the desired output, which helps the model to learn the patterns and relationships between the input code and the expected mutants. In contrast, role_prompting relies on the model's ability to understand the role and generate a response accordingly, which may not always lead to accurate results. This focused guidance enables the model to produce more accurate and relevant mutants.
3. **Lack of Role Bias**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique is less prone to bias introduced by role_prompting, where the assigned role may influence the model's behavior and lead to suboptimal results. By avoiding the introduction of role-based bias, exemplar_selection_knn allows the model to generate mutants based solely on the input code and the provided examples, resulting in more objective and accurate outputs. This reduction in bias contributes to the overall better performance of the exemplar_selection_knn technique.
