üîç Running test: meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo | Task: mutant_generation | Best: exemplar_selection_knn vs Other: self_ask

1. **Contextual Enrichment**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique performs better because it enriches the prompt context with similar code examples, allowing the model to learn from relevant and related code snippets. This contextual enrichment enables the model to generate more accurate and relevant mutant code. As a result, the model can produce higher-quality responses that meet the task requirements.
2. **Focused Guidance**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique provides focused guidance to the model by selecting the most similar code examples, which helps the model to stay on track and generate mutant code that is consistent with the provided examples. This focused guidance reduces the likelihood of the model generating irrelevant or incorrect code, leading to better performance.
3. **Reduced Ambiguity**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique reduces ambiguity in the prompt by providing concrete examples of mutant code, which helps the model to understand the task requirements more clearly. In contrast, the self_ask technique may introduce additional ambiguity by asking clarifying questions, which can lead to confusion and lower-quality responses. By reducing ambiguity, the exemplar_selection_knn technique enables the model to generate more accurate and relevant mutant code.
