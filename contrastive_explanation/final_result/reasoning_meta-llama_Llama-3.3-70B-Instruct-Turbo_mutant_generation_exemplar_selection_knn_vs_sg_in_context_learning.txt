üîç Running test: meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo | Task: mutant_generation | Best: exemplar_selection_knn vs Other: sg_in_context_learning

1. **Contextual Relevance**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique performs better because it selects the most similar code examples to enrich the prompt context, making the provided examples more relevant to the task of mutant generation. This relevance helps the model understand the subtle changes required for mutant generation. As a result, the model can generate more accurate and context-specific mutants.
2. **Focused Guidance**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique offers more focused guidance by providing examples that are closely related to the task, allowing the model to learn from these examples and generate mutants that are more likely to be correct. In contrast, sg_in_context_learning may generate more generic or less relevant examples, leading to poorer performance. This focused guidance enables the model to produce higher-quality mutants.
3. **Reduced Ambiguity**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique reduces ambiguity in the prompt by providing clear and relevant examples, which helps the model to better understand the task requirements and generate mutants that meet these requirements. In contrast, sg_in_context_learning may introduce more ambiguity, leading to mutants that are less accurate or less relevant to the task. By reducing ambiguity, the exemplar_selection_knn technique enables the model to produce more accurate and effective mutants.
