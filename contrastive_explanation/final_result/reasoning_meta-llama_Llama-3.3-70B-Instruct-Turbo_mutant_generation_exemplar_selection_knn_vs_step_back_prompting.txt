üîç Running test: meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo | Task: mutant_generation | Best: exemplar_selection_knn vs Other: step_back_prompting

1. **Contextual Relevance**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique performs better because it selects the most similar code examples to enrich the prompt context, providing the model with highly relevant information to generate accurate mutants. This relevance helps the model understand the specific requirements and constraints of the task, leading to more effective mutant generation. As a result, the model can produce higher-quality responses that meet the task's needs.
2. **Focused Guidance**: Exemplar_selection_knn offers more focused guidance by providing concrete examples of mutant code, which helps the model learn from these examples and generate similar mutants. In contrast, step_back_prompting provides more general guidance, which may not be sufficient for the model to produce high-quality mutants. This focused guidance enables the model to better understand the task's requirements and generate more accurate responses.
3. **Reduced Ambiguity**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique reduces ambiguity in the prompt by providing clear examples of the desired output, allowing the model to generate mutants with minimal modifications. This clarity helps the model avoid introducing unnecessary changes or incorrect assumptions, resulting in more accurate and relevant mutants. In contrast, step_back_prompting may introduce more ambiguity, leading to lower-quality responses that do not meet the task's requirements.
