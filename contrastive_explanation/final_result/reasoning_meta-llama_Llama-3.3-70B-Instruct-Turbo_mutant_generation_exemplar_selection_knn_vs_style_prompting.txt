üîç Running test: meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo | Task: mutant_generation | Best: exemplar_selection_knn vs Other: style_prompting

1. **Contextual Relevance**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique performs better because it selects the most similar code examples to enrich the prompt context, making the model more likely to generate relevant and accurate mutant code. This approach ensures that the model is exposed to contextually relevant information, which is crucial for tasks like mutant generation. As a result, the model can produce higher-quality responses.
2. **Syntactic Similarity**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique outperforms style_prompting because it focuses on syntactic similarity between the input code and the generated mutant code. By selecting similar code examples, the model can learn to generate mutant code that is syntactically similar to the original code, which is essential for maintaining the overall intent and structure of the code. This similarity helps the model produce more accurate and relevant mutant code.
3. **Minimal Modification**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique excels at generating mutant code with minimal modifications, which is a key aspect of mutant generation. By providing examples of slightly modified code, the model learns to make subtle changes to the original code, resulting in higher-quality mutant code that meets the task's requirements. In contrast, style_prompting may introduce more significant changes or unnecessary complexity, leading to lower evaluation scores.
