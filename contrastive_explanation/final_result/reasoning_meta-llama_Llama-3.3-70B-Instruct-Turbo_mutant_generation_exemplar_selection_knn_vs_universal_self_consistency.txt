üîç Running test: meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo | Task: mutant_generation | Best: exemplar_selection_knn vs Other: universal_self_consistency

1. **Contextual Relevance**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique performs better because it selects the most similar code examples to enrich the prompt context, making the generated responses more relevant and accurate. This approach allows the model to focus on the specific task of mutant generation, leveraging the provided examples to inform its decisions. As a result, the generated mutants are more likely to be correct and useful.
2. **Targeted Guidance**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique provides targeted guidance to the model by presenting it with relevant examples of mutant generation, which helps to steer the model towards producing high-quality responses. This guidance enables the model to learn from the examples and apply the same principles to generate new mutants, resulting in more effective and robust responses. By focusing on the specific task, the model can produce better results.
3. **Reduced Ambiguity**: The exemplar_selection_knn technique reduces ambiguity in the prompt by providing clear and concise examples of the desired output, which helps the model to understand the task requirements more accurately. This reduced ambiguity enables the model to generate responses that are more precise and relevant, with less room for misinterpretation or confusion. As a result, the exemplar_selection_knn technique produces more accurate and reliable results compared to the universal_self_consistency technique.
