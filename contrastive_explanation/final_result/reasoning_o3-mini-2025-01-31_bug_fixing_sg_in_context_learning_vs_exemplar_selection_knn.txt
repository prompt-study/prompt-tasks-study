üîç Running test: o3-mini-2025-01-31 | Task: bug_fixing | Best: sg_in_context_learning vs Other: exemplar_selection_knn

1. Dynamic Example Generation: sg_in_context_learning dynamically generates in-context examples tailored to the specific bug scenario, which creates a highly relevant learning environment. This dynamic tailoring ensures that the examples directly address the nuances of the code issue, leading to more precise and effective bug fixes.

2. Holistic Contextual Understanding: By synthesizing multiple aspects of the bug and the intended fix within a single consistent narrative, sg_in_context_learning offers comprehensive context. This integrated approach helps the model better understand the overall structure and intended behavior of the code, resulting in fixes that maintain both functionality and style.

3. Enhanced Explanatory Clarity: The technique provides paired examples with clear annotations (e.g., ###bug### and ###fix###), which not only guide the debugging process but also clarify the rationale behind each change. This explicit demonstration of reasoning aids the model in faithfully reproducing high-quality, human-like bug fix solutions.
