üîç Running test: o3-mini-2025-01-31 | Task: bug_fixing | Best: sg_in_context_learning vs Other: self_ask

1. Clear In-Context Examples: The sg_in_context_learning technique leverages explicit examples that clearly demonstrate the desired bug and fix transformations. This guidance helps the model understand exactly how to reformat and correct the code, reducing ambiguity in the task requirements.

2. Consistent Output Structure: By providing labeled cases (e.g., ###bug### and ###fix###), the in-context learning approach enforces a structured response that mirrors human formatting standards. This consistency not only makes the output easier to evaluate but also minimizes errors that might occur when trying to decompose the problem independently.

3. Focused Task Execution: The sg_in_context_learning method directly simulates the target task through concrete examples, so the model focuses on code transformation rather than asking clarifying questions. In contrast, the self_ask technique can introduce unnecessary steps and ambiguity, potentially leading to deviations from the desired concise code corrections.
