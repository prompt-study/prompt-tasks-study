üîç Running test: o3-mini-2025-01-31 | Task: bug_fixing | Best: sg_in_context_learning vs Other: thread_of_thought

1. Focus on Examples: The sg_in_context_learning technique provides clear, explicit examples of buggy versus fixed code. This direct demonstration allows the model to mirror the correct structure and formatting without getting sidetracked by unnecessary justifications.

2. Reduced Cognitive Overhead: By not requiring a detailed step-by-step reasoning process, this technique minimizes extraneous information. This keeps the response focused on producing the final, correct output rather than detailing the debugging thought process, leading to a cleaner and more effective solution.

3. Consistency in Output Format: The sg_in_context_learning method emphasizes maintaining a consistent format (e.g., labeled examples with ###bug### and ###fix###). This consistency helps in generating predictable, high-quality responses that align closely with human expectations for the bug fixing task.
