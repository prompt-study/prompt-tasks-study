üîç Running test: o3-mini-2025-01-31 | Task: bug_fixing | Best: sg_in_context_learning vs Other: universal_self_consistency

1. Explicit Example Guidance: The sg_in_context_learning technique leverages clear, specific examples that directly illustrate the desired output format (e.g., labeling code sections with ###bug### and ###fix###). This direct modeling helps the model understand exactly what structure and style to produce, which is particularly useful for tasks like bug fixing where format clarity is essential.

2. Reduced Ambiguity in Requirements: In-context examples provide concrete cues about both the expected corrections and coding conventions. By embedding working examples into the prompt, sg_in_context_learning minimizes ambiguity, ensuring that the model aligns closely with the intended changes, rather than guessing multiple possible corrections as in universal_self_consistency.

3. Consistent Structural Output: The approach of simulating few-shot learning with curated examples gives the model a consistent structure to follow throughout its response. This consistency contrasts with the universal_self_consistency technique, where aggregating multiple outputs might introduce variability and less precise adherence to specific formatting instructions.
