üîç Running test: o3-mini-2025-01-31 | Task: clone_detection | Best: emotional_prompting vs Other: few_shot_contrastive_cot

1. Direct Answer Focus: Emotional_prompting encourages responses that are succinct and focused on delivering a clear, unambiguous answer. This is especially useful for tasks like clone detection where the objective is simply to return TRUE or FALSE without extraneous reasoning that could confuse the final output.

2. Minimal Distraction: By avoiding extensive internal chain-of-thought explanations, the emotional_prompting technique provides a straightforward answer without revealing the internal reasoning process. This results in outputs that align more closely with user expectations for a concise response, reducing cognitive overload for the end-user.

3. Confidence and Clarity: Incorporating assertive and affective language helps the model convey confidence in its decision. This approach creates a perception of clarity and decisiveness, which is valuable in tasks requiring binary responses, ensuring that developers and users quickly understand the result without sifting through detailed intermediate analysis.
