üîç Running test: o3-mini-2025-01-31 | Task: clone_detection | Best: emotional_prompting vs Other: thread_of_thought

1. Direct Clarity: Emotional prompting instructs the model to provide a simple, decisive response (like "###FALSE###") without additional elaboration. This directness minimizes confusion and ensures that the output strictly matches the required format, leading to higher quality responses for tasks that demand clear binary answers.

2. Enhanced Focus on Output: The emotional_prompting approach leverages engaging language to emphasize the importance of delivering the final answer with conviction. This focus avoids unnecessary intermediate steps that can distract from the core task, ensuring that the critical decision is prominently and accurately communicated.

3. Reduced Cognitive Overload: Emotional prompting steers clear of verbose, step-by-step analyses that can dilute the final result. By concentrating on the end answer instead of detailing the reasoning process internally, the response becomes more efficient, meeting the task requirements without overwhelming the reader with excess information.
