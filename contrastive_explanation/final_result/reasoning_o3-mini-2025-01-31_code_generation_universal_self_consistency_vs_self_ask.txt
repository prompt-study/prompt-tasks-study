1. Aggregated Consensus: Universal self consistency aggregates multiple reasoning outputs, ensuring that the final answer is derived from a consensus. This approach minimizes individual reasoning errors and inconsistencies, thereby producing a more robust and accurate code solution.

2. Reduced Ambiguity: The universal self consistency method produces a final answer without requiring additional clarifying questions. By synthesizing outputs from various reasoning paths, it minimizes ambiguity and misinterpretations that may occur if the model had to ask preliminary clarifying questions.

3. Direct Focus on Final Output: Universal self consistency focuses on evaluating and selecting the most coherent solution without breaking the problem into sub-questions. This streamlined process results in a direct, complete, and contextually accurate response, which is beneficial for tasks like code generation where concise and correct implementation matter.
