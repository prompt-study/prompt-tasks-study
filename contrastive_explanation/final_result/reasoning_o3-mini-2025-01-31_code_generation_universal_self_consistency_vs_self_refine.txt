üîç Running test: o3-mini-2025-01-31 | Task: code_generation | Best: universal_self_consistency vs Other: self_refine

1. Aggregated Consensus: By combining multiple independent responses, universal_self_consistency selects the solution that best represents a majority view. This aggregation minimizes the impact of outliers or initial errors, leading to a more robust and well-rounded code generation result.

2. Improved Error Detection: Universal_self_consistency benefits from evaluating several reasoning paths, which increases the likelihood of detecting and correcting bugs or inconsistencies. This cross-verification between multiple outputs ensures that errors are less likely to be overlooked compared to the iterative self_refine approach.

3. Enhanced Coherence: The meta-prompt used in universal_self_consistency encourages overall coherence across the generated responses. By choosing the most consistent solution from several iterations, it helps produce a final code output that aligns more closely with the intended task requirements, enhancing clarity and maintainability.
