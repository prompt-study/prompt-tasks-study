üîç Running test: o3-mini-2025-01-31 | Task: code_generation | Best: universal_self_consistency vs Other: tree_of_thought

1. Consistency Aggregation: The universal_self_consistency technique gathers multiple reasoning outputs into one coherent result using a meta-prompt. This aggregation helps ensure that the final code is consistent and aligns with a consensus view, minimizing discrepancies that might arise from diverse reasoning branches.

2. Focused Output Selection: By selecting the answer that best reflects the majority consensus, universal_self_consistency avoids the pitfalls of over-exploration. In contrast, the tree_of_thought approach may overcomplicate the process with multiple branching paths that do not always converge neatly on a single high-quality solution.

3. Reduced Iterative Overhead: Universal_self_consistency efficiently converges on a final answer by integrating insights from several iterations, whereas tree_of_thought requires step-by-step reasoning and intermediate evaluations. This streamlined process minimizes extraneous details, leading to a more direct and robust final code implementation.
