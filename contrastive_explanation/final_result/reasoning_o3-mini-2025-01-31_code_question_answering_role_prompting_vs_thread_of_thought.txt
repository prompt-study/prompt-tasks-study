üîç Running test: o3-mini-2025-01-31 | Task: code_question_answering | Best: role_prompting vs Other: thread_of_thought

1. Focused Expertise: Role prompting assigns a specific role such as "Code Reviewer" or "Software Architect" that naturally emphasizes verifying code correctness. This direct alignment with the task leads to clear, concise answers without unnecessary elaboration.

2. Precision in Output: With role prompting, the instructions emphasize providing a straightforward outcome (e.g., "###TRUE###" or "###FALSE###") that aligns with the evaluation criteria. This precision helps avoid the extra narrative found in thread_of_thought prompts, ensuring the answer is both succinct and on target.

3. Reduced Cognitive Overhead: Role prompting limits the response to the essential assessment required for the task, bypassing the internal chain-of-thought reasoning. This results in a cleaner output, diminishing the risk of digressions or inconsistent reasoning while directly addressing the code question.
