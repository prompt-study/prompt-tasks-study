üîç Running test: o3-mini-2025-01-31 | Task: code_question_answering | Best: role_prompting vs Other: tree_of_thought

1. Direct Role Alignment: Role_prompting assigns a clear persona (like a Senior Software Engineer or Security Engineer), which guides the answer to align precisely with the task's context. This focused role allows the model to leverage domain-specific knowledge rapidly, while tree_of_thought may branch into unnecessary details, deviating from the core evaluation criteria.

2. Enhanced Conciseness: Role_prompting leads to succinct responses that directly address the query without extraneous reasoning. In contrast, tree_of_thought prompts encourage step-by-step, iterative breakdowns that can result in verbose answers not strictly needed for the binary decision required by the code question answering task.

3. Consistent Output Format: By using role_prompting, the model is more likely to produce a standardized and predictable answer format (e.g., just returning ###TRUE### or ###FALSE###), ensuring clarity and compliance. Tree_of_thought, with its layered reasoning, might introduce variable result formats that can be less directly useful in a scenario requiring a precise, minimal output.
