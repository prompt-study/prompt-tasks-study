üîç Running test: o3-mini-2025-01-31 | Task: code_translation | Best: exemplar_selection_knn vs Other: role_prompting

1. Context-Enriched Guidance: Exemplar_selection_knn provides highly relevant examples that illustrate how specific Java constructs map to their C# counterparts. This enriched context helps the model generate translations that correctly replace APIs, method signatures, and naming conventions using proven patterns instead of relying solely on generic rules.

2. Consistent Structural Mapping: By including similar examples, the knn technique reinforces consistent structural transformations such as method declarations, virtual modifiers, and options invocation styles. This consistency leads to higher-quality outputs since the model can mimic the precise formatting and structural patterns required in C#.

3. Reduced Ambiguity in Translation: The example-based approach minimizes ambiguity by explicitly showing how to convert various code elements. In contrast, role_prompting only provides a persona and vague instructions, which can lead to literal translations that disregard the specific nuances of translating between languages.
