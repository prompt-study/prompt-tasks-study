üîç Running test: o3-mini-2025-01-31 | Task: code_translation | Best: exemplar_selection_knn vs Other: tree_of_thought

1. Targeted Contextualization: The exemplar_selection_knn technique enriches the prompt with highly relevant, similar code examples, which guide the translation process directly. This targeted context ensures that the converted code follows the desired syntax and conventions without unnecessary deviations.

2. Minimal Extraneous Reasoning: Unlike tree_of_thought, which encourages layering and intermediate reasoning steps, exemplar_selection_knn focuses solely on execution. This results in less risk of accidentally incorporating irrelevant intermediate thought processes that might degrade the final output quality.

3. Consistency with Expert Examples: By drawing on similar high-quality translation pairs, the exemplar_selection_knn approach consistently mirrors expert-level coding patterns. This alignment with proven examples helps maintain the precision and idiomatic correctness required for accurate code translation.
