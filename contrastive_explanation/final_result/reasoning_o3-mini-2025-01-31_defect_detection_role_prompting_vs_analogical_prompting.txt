üîç Running test: o3-mini-2025-01-31 | Task: defect_detection | Best: role_prompting vs Other: analogical_prompting

1. Persona Precision: By assigning a clear software engineering role (such as Technical Lead or Developer), the role_prompting technique aligns the assistant‚Äôs internal context with the expertise required for defect detection. This direct role alignment enables a focused analysis of the code, minimizing irrelevant elaborations that might stem from general analogies.

2. Response Conciseness: Role_prompting instructs the assistant to provide a simple, definitive answer (###TRUE### or ###FALSE###), reducing the likelihood of digressions or overly elaborate reasoning. This streamlined approach leads to high-quality responses that directly address the task without unnecessary complexity.

3. Reduced Cognitive Overhead: With role_prompting, the assistant isn‚Äôt burdened by creating auxiliary examples or drawing analogies to unrelated contexts, as seen in analogical prompting. This focused cognitive load lets the assistant concentrate on assessing the actual code snippet, resulting in more accurate and consistent defect detection responses.
