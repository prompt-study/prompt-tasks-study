üîç Running test: o3-mini-2025-01-31 | Task: defect_detection | Best: role_prompting vs Other: few_shot_contrastive_cot

1. Clear Role Definition: By assigning a specific role (e.g., Senior Software Engineer, Technical Lead), the role_prompting technique immediately sets the context and expertise level expected, resulting in more authoritative and focused responses that directly address the defect detection problem without unnecessary side commentary.

2. Reduced Extraneous Reasoning: Role_prompting restricts the answer format (e.g., "###TRUE###" or "###FALSE###" only) which minimizes the occurrence of additional chain-of-thought reasoning. This streamlined approach leads to concise outputs that precisely follow the task instructions and avoid diluting the answer quality with irrelevant details.

3. Consistent Response Style: With role_prompting, the model is guided to adopt a consistent communication style geared toward a professional setting, which improves reliability across similar queries. This consistency ensures that only the necessary contextual information is included, leading to high-quality, predictable responses compared to the more variable outputs seen with few_shot_contrastive_cot.
