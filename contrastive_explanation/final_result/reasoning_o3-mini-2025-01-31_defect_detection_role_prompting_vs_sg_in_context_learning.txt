üîç Running test: o3-mini-2025-01-31 | Task: defect_detection | Best: role_prompting vs Other: sg_in_context_learning

1. Focused Expertise: Role_prompting assigns a clear professional persona (like Code Reviewer or Quality Assurance Engineer), which guides the model to respond with the specific expertise needed for defect detection. This focus on domain-specific context reduces ambiguity and leads to more precise, context-aware responses.

2. Strict Output Guidance: With role_prompting, the instructions explicitly require a minimal and specific answer format (e.g., just "###TRUE###" or "###FALSE###"). This succinct directive minimizes extraneous commentary and helps the model concentrate solely on the defect detection task, leading to clearer and more predictable outputs.

3. Enhanced Consistency: By simulating a role that inherently understands the nuances of code quality and security, the technique leverages the model‚Äôs ability to internalize expert-level reasoning. This dedicated perspective produces responses that are not only contextually accurate but also consistent across varied examples, in contrast to the sometimes verbose or off-target outputs generated by sg_in_context_learning.
