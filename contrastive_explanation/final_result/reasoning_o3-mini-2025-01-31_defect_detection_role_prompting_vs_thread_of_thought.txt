üîç Running test: o3-mini-2025-01-31 | Task: defect_detection | Best: role_prompting vs Other: thread_of_thought

1. Concise Answer Focus: Role prompting explicitly instructs the model to provide only the final output (e.g., "###TRUE###" or "###FALSE###"), ensuring that the response is concise and directly aligned with the task's requirements. This brevity prevents extraneous information that could confuse evaluators or deviate from the expected answer format.

2. Task-Specific Persona Alignment: With role prompting, the model is assigned a defined persona (like "Senior Software Engineer" or "Quality Assurance Engineer") that naturally aligns its response style with the task's domain. This helps ensure that the output reflects the professional tone and expertise needed for defect identification in code, while reducing the risk of over-explanation.

3. Reduced Cognitive Load and Risk of Error: By focusing solely on the required output without detailing intermediate reasoning steps, role prompting minimizes the risk of including irrelevant reasoning or mistakes. This streamlined approach makes it less likely for the model to disclose its internal thought process, which can be error-prone and misaligned with the precise answer expected by the task.
