üîç Running test: o3-mini-2025-01-31 | Task: exception_type | Best: rephrase_and_respond vs Other: emotional_prompting

1. Clarity of Requirements: Rephrasing the query forces the model to explicitly restate the technical requirements, ensuring it fully comprehends the problem context. This leads to more accurate and detailed responses that focus directly on the exception type prediction instead of being sidetracked by non-technical language.

2. Focus on Technical Details: The rephrase_and_respond technique directs the model's attention to the critical aspects of the code and the exception handling logic. This emphasis on technical analysis results in a response that is both precise and contextually relevant, whereas emotional_prompting may inject unnecessary affective elements.

3. Promotes Structured Reasoning: By encouraging the restatement and expansion of the problem, rephrase_and_respond naturally fosters a step-by-step logical reasoning process. This structured approach makes it easier to derive the correct exception type, while the emotional prompt's motivational tone might detract from systematic, technical evaluation.
