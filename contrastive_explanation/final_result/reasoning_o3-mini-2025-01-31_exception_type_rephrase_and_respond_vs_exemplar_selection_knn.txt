üîç Running test: o3-mini-2025-01-31 | Task: exception_type | Best: rephrase_and_respond vs Other: exemplar_selection_knn

1. Clarity and Conceptual Reframing: The rephrase_and_respond technique prompts the model to restate and elaborate on the task, which clears up any ambiguity in the original query. This process helps the model better understand the context and intent behind the code, leading to a more precise answer.

2. Enhanced Analytical Reasoning: By rephrasing and expanding the question, the model is encouraged to think through the problem step-by-step instead of relying solely on surface similarities with previous examples. This deep processing leads to correct identification of the exception types based on the code's behavior, as opposed to exemplar_selection_knn which might merely match patterns.

3. Improved Adaptability to Variations: The rephrase_and_respond technique makes the model more flexible in adapting to subtle differences or nuances in code snippets and requirements. Rather than being confined to pre-selected exemplars, the model synthesizes its understanding from the reworded prompt, ensuring a higher quality and more context-aware response.
