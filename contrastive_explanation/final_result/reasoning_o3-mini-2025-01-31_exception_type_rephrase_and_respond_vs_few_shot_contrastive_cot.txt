üîç Running test: o3-mini-2025-01-31 | Task: exception_type | Best: rephrase_and_respond vs Other: few_shot_contrastive_cot

1. Enhanced Comprehension: By rephrasing the query, the model ensures it fully understands the essential requirements of the task, leading to a more targeted response. This technique reduces ambiguity by explicitly restating the problem in its own words, which fosters clarity in the final answer.

2. Focused Response Delivery: The rephrase_and_respond method centers on restating a refined version of the original question, which keeps the answer aligned with the core task without unnecessary elaboration. This focused approach minimizes digressions and ensures that the response directly addresses the exception type prediction challenge.

3. Reduced Overexplanation Noise: Unlike the few_shot_contrastive_cot technique that exposes detailed internal reasoning, rephrase_and_respond streamlines the answer to be concise and to the point. This helps in delivering a clear result without the extraneous step-by-step reasoning that might distract from the concise final conclusion.
