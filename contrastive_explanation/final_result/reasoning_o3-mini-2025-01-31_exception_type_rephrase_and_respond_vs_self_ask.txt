üîç Running test: o3-mini-2025-01-31 | Task: exception_type | Best: rephrase_and_respond vs Other: self_ask

1. Focused Restatement: By rephrasing and expanding on the prompt, the model reinforces its understanding of the code and task requirements. This focused restatement minimizes misinterpretation and keeps the answer directly aligned with the specific exception type needed.

2. Streamlined Response: Rephrase_and_respond encourages the model to internalize and consolidate the main points of the inquiry before responding. This leads to a more concise and direct final answer, avoiding unnecessary digressions that might occur when generating and resolving additional sub-questions.

3. Enhanced Clarity and Format Adherence: The technique explicitly directs the model to restate the query and then supply an answer in a specified format. This dual-step process reduces ambiguity and ensures that the response is formatted correctly and clearly communicates the reasoning behind the selected exception type.
