üîç Running test: o3-mini-2025-01-31 | Task: exception_type | Best: rephrase_and_respond vs Other: self_refine

1. Improved Understanding: By rephrasing the prompt, the model ensures it fully comprehends the task requirements and nuances, reducing misunderstandings. This initial rewording makes it easier to capture key details such as the exception's context and behavior within the code.

2. Context Reinforcement: Rephrase_and_respond forces the model to articulate its own understanding of the code before answering, thereby reinforcing the relevant context. This detailed restatement helps identify hidden assumptions and ensures that the response aligns closely with developer intentions.

3. Reduced Iterative Drift: Since rephrase_and_respond addresses the entire query in a single pass, it minimizes the risk of error accumulation over several steps that can occur in self_refine. This direct approach leads to a more consistent and authoritative response without iterative refinement potentially introducing ambiguities.
