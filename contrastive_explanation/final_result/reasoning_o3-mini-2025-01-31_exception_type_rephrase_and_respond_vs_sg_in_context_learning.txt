üîç Running test: o3-mini-2025-01-31 | Task: exception_type | Best: rephrase_and_respond vs Other: sg_in_context_learning

1. Enhanced Clarity: Rephrase_and_respond forces the model to restate and deepen its understanding of the task, leading to a clearer grasp of the exact expectations. This detailed interpretation helps eliminate any ambiguity inherent in the original query and guides the model toward a more focused and accurate answer.

2. Improved Contextual Reasoning: By rephrasing the question, the model can elaborate on the context and underlying logic required for the software task. This process builds a more complete picture of the problem, which results in better alignment between the code‚Äôs behavior and the appropriate exception handling strategy.

3. Increased Answer Precision: The technique encourages the model to break down and analyze the problem step-by-step before providing a solution. This methodical approach minimizes errors and hones in on the specific exception type needed, resulting in a more precise and trustworthy response compared to using in-context example generation alone.
