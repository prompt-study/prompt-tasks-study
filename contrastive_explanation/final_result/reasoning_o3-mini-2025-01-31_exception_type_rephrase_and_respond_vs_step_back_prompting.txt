üîç Running test: o3-mini-2025-01-31 | Task: exception_type | Best: rephrase_and_respond vs Other: step_back_prompting

1. Enhanced Clarity: By having the model rephrase the prompt, it ensures that the key components and constraints of the task‚Äîsuch as the specific context in which the exception occurs‚Äîare clearly understood. This clarity reduces the chance of misinterpreting subtle code nuances.

2. Focused Detailing: Rephrasing forces the model to restate critical details, which helps in highlighting the error conditions directly related to the exception in the code. This focused recapitulation creates a more precise mental model, leading to a high-quality response that directly addresses the core issue.

3. Reduced Cognitive Distraction: The rephrase_and_respond technique channels the model's attention strictly towards the problem statement, minimizing divergence into broader explanations. This minimal cognitive overhead helps in delivering concise and accurate responses, as it limits extraneous reasoning that may occur in more open-ended step-back approaches.
