üîç Running test: o3-mini-2025-01-31 | Task: exception_type | Best: rephrase_and_respond vs Other: thread_of_thought

1. Focused Question Restatement: The rephrase_and_respond technique forces the model to restate the query in its own words, ensuring it fully grasps what‚Äôs being asked. This leads to a clear and precise identification of exception types without getting sidetracked by less relevant code details.

2. Direct Answer Formatting: By emphasizing a specific response format (e.g., ‚Äú###ExceptionType###‚Äù), the rephrase approach minimizes ambiguity in the final output. This structured format is particularly effective for exception type prediction, resulting in responses that align perfectly with expected answer templates.

3. Enhanced Clarity and Conciseness: Rephrasing encourages the model to distill the core problem and requirements before answering, which aids in generating concise, on-point responses. This method avoids overcomplicating the explanation with unnecessary step-by-step code traversal, making the answer clearer and more accessible.
