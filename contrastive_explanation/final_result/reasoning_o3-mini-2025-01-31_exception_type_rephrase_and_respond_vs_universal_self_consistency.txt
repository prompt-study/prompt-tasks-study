üîç Running test: o3-mini-2025-01-31 | Task: exception_type | Best: rephrase_and_respond vs Other: universal_self_consistency

1. Clarity and Focus: Rephrasing the prompt forces the model to reinterpret and clearly understand the specific requirements of the task, reducing ambiguity in the instruction. This focused rearticulation helps the model zero in on the code details and exception handling logic, leading to a higher quality, targeted response.

2. Contextual Enrichment: The rephrase_and_respond technique encourages expanding the context and elaborating on the problem statement before answering. This extra step helps the model consider nuances in the code and the intended behavior, ensuring that the selected exception type is supported by a well-rounded understanding of the scenario.

3. Reduced Aggregation Noise: Unlike universal_self_consistency, which relies on choosing among multiple generated responses and may suffer from inconsistencies or conflicting reasoning paths, rephrase_and_respond provides a single, coherent thought process. This direct approach minimizes the risk of dilution or misalignment in reasoning, resulting in more robust and reliable outputs for the specific exception type prediction task.
