üîç Running test: o3-mini-2025-01-31 | Task: mutant_generation | Best: role_prompting vs Other: tree_of_thought

1. Clarity of Instruction: Role prompting provides a clear role and direct task description, which minimizes ambiguity. This clear framing helps the model focus on generating subtle mutations without overcomplicating the process through unnecessary iterative reasoning.

2. Conciseness and Focus: Role prompting instructs the model to output just the mutated code, while tree_of_thought invites intermediate steps and analyses. With tree_of_thought, the extra reasoning steps can introduce unintended modifications and distract from the core objective of making small, precise changes.

3. Consistency in Output: By assigning a specific role, the model is nudged to adopt a consistent style that aligns with domain expectations, leading to higher-quality and more reliable code transformations. In contrast, the iterative approach of tree_of_thought can yield varied responses, resulting in inconsistent modifications that may not align with the intended minimal mutation.
