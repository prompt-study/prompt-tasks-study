Below are 15 complete prompt templates. Variation 0 is exactly your original template. The remaining 14 variations have the strings within the SystemMessagePromptTemplate and HumanMessagePromptTemplate reworded, while the AIMessagePromptTemplate remains unchanged. In order to keep the original variable name intact, I’ve kept the original version as mutant_generation_template_tree_of_thought and appended a suffix (_1, _2, …, _14) for the new variations.
